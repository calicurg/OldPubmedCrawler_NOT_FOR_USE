# OldPubmedCrawler_NOT_FOR_USE

This Pubmed Crawler was extensively used in the period from 2015 to 2019.
However, now this crawler would not meet the new NCBI policy for data acquisition, because this crawler would get the information directly from corresponding web-pages. According to the new NCBI policy, the open data would be legally available for crawlers using special E-utils API; moreover, special NCBI instructions should be followed to avoid server overload.
The up-to-date Pubmed Crawler that was designed to meet these new requirements is also available in my profile at 
https://github.com/calicurg/NCBI_EUTLS_Crawler
You can find more information on NCBI E-utils policy here
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25497/ 
In particular (citation):
“In order not to overload the E-utility servers, NCBI recommends that users post no more than three URL requests per second and limit large jobs to either weekends or between 9:00 PM and 5:00 AM Eastern time during weekdays. Failure to comply with this policy may result in an IP address being blocked from accessing NCBI “
