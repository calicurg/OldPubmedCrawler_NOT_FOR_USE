S' Current guidelines recommend treatment with capecitabine and bevacizumab for patients (pts) with non-resectable metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), although clinical data in this particular patient group are lacking.METHODS:  Previously untreated patients with non-resectable mCRC were to receive capecitabine (1,250\xc2\xa0mg/sqm bid d1-14 oral) and bevacizumab (7.5\xc2\xa0mg/kg i.v.) every 3\xc2\xa0weeks. Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR) and toxicity.RESULTS:  82 pts were included: 40 female, median age 70 (range 50-86). ECOG PS 0/1/2 was 38/52/10%, respectively. Synchronous metastases were present in 58 pts. 16 pts had primary tumor in situ. Median treatment duration was 4.1\xc2\xa0months (6\xc2\xa0cycles). Toxicity was generally mild. ORR was 38%, with 5 complete and 23 partial responses. Median PFS was 7.0\xc2\xa0months [95% CI (5.0-9.1)] and OS 17.9\xc2\xa0months [95% CI (14.6-21.6)]. Second- and third-line systemic therapy was given to 57% and 33% of pts, respectively.S:  Besides the favourable tolerability, PFS and OS were shorter than reported by other trials. Careful patient selection for upfront capecitabine and bevacizumab is essential.'

S' We hypothesized that the combination of bevacizumab, carboplatin, and pemetrexed will be an effective first-line regimen in fit, elderly patients with nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer.METHODS:  Treatment-na\xc3\xafve, stage IIIB/IV nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer patients more than 70 years old with good performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1) and adequate organ function were eligible. Carboplatin area under the curve 6, pemetrexed 500 mg/m, and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg were administered on day 1 of each 21-day cycle (up to six cycles) followed by maintenance pemetrexed and bevacizumab. The primary end point of 6-month progression-free survival rate of at least 70% was assessed using a one-stage binomial design. Quality of life (QOL) questionnaires were administered. Polymorphisms in genes encoding relevant proteins (drug targets, transport, and metabolism proteins) were correlated with treatment outcome.RESULTS:  Fifty-seven eligible patients were enrolled. Median age was 74.5 years. Median treatment cycles received was 6. The most common grade 3 or higher non-hematologic adverse events were fatigue (26%) and hypertension (11%); 16% had grade 4 neutropenia and 6.5% had grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Three patients experienced grade 3/4 hemorrhagic events (one pulmonary, two gastrointestinal). Primary end point of PFS6 was 60% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 45.9-73%). Median PFS was 7.0 months (95% CI: 5.9-10.1), median overall survival was 13.7 months (95% CI: 9.4-16.8). Polymorphic KDR and VEGFA variants correlated with survival and toxicity, respectively. There was no significant change in overall QOL scores over time.: "" This regimen is feasible and did not decrease the QOL in this study population. However, it did not meet the primary efficacy end point.'

S' In the TRIBE study, FOLFOXIRI (fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan) plus bevacizumab significantly improved progression-free survival of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer compared with FOLFIRI (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan) plus bevacizumab. In this updated analysis, we aimed to provide mature results for overall survival-a secondary endpoint-and report treatment efficacy in RAS and BRAF molecular subgroups.METHODS: TRIBE was an open-label, multicentre, phase 3 randomised study of patients (aged 18-70 years with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] performance status of 2 or less and aged 71-75 years with an ECOG performance status of 0) with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer who were recruited from 34 Italian oncology units. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via a web-based procedure to receive FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab or FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab. Bevacizumab was given as a 5 mg/kg intravenous dose. FOLFIRI consisted of a 180 mg/m(2) intravenous infusion of irinotecan for 60 min followed by a 200 mg/m(2) intravenous infusion of leucovorin for 120 min, a 400 mg/m(2) intravenous bolus of fluorouracil, and a 2400 mg/m(2) continuous infusion of fluorouracil for 46 h. FOLFOXIRI consisted of a 165 mg/m(2) intravenous infusion of irinotecan for 60 min, followed by an 85 mg/m(2) intravenous infusion of oxaliplatin given concurrently with 200 mg/m(2) leucovorin for 120 min, followed by a 3200 mg/m(2) continuous infusion of fluorouracil for 48 h. Tissue samples for RAS and BRAF mutational status analyses were centrally collected. In this updated analysis, we assessed the secondary endpoint of overall survival in the main cohort and treatment efficacy in RAS and BRAF molecular subgroups. All analyses were by intention to treat. TRIBE was concluded on Nov 30, 2014. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00719797" title="See in ClincalTrials.gov"NCT00719797</a.FINDINGS: "FINDINGS" Between July 17, 2008, and May 31, 2011, 508 patients were randomly assigned. At a median follow-up of 48\xc2\xb71 months (IQR 41\xc2\xb77-55\xc2\xb76), median overall survival was 29\xc2\xb78 months (95% CI 26\xc2\xb70-34\xc2\xb73) in the FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab group compared with 25\xc2\xb78 months (22\xc2\xb75-29\xc2\xb71) in the FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab group (hazard ratio [HR] 0\xc2\xb780, 95% CI 0\xc2\xb765-0\xc2\xb798; p=0\xc2\xb703). Median overall survival was 37\xc2\xb71 months (95% CI 29\xc2\xb77-42\xc2\xb77) in the RAS and BRAF wild-type subgroup compared with 25\xc2\xb76 months (22\xc2\xb74-28\xc2\xb76) in the RAS-mutation-positive subgroup (HR 1\xc2\xb749, 95% CI 1\xc2\xb711-1\xc2\xb799) and 13\xc2\xb74 months (8\xc2\xb72-24\xc2\xb71) in the BRAF-mutation-positive subgroup (HR 2\xc2\xb779, 95% CI 1\xc2\xb775-4\xc2\xb746; likelihood-ratio test p<0\xc2\xb70001). Treatment effect was not significantly different across molecular subgroups (pinteraction=0\xc2\xb752).INTERPRETATION: "INTERPRETATION" FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab is a feasible treatment option for those patients who meet the inclusion criteria of the present study, irrespective of baseline clinical characteristics and RAS or BRAF mutational status.'

S' Sorafenib and bevacizumab as single agents have shown efficacy and acceptable toxicity in NETs phase II trials. Sorafenib and bevacizumab combination has shown manageable toxicity in phase I trials in solid tumours. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of sorafenib and bevacizumab in patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumours.METHODS:  Open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter, phase II clinical trial.ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: "ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA" age \xe2\x89\xa518 years, histologically confirmed measurable advanced NETs; 1 prior chemotherapy allowed; ECOG-PS 0-2. Patients were treated during 6 months and followed up for an additional 6 months.TREATMENT: "TREATMENT" sorafenib 200mg bid (days 1-5 of each week) and bevacizumab 5mg/kg once every 2 weeks (day 1, week 1). Tumour response was performed according to RECIST (v1.0) every 2 months during the treatment period. Adverse events were graded according to CTCAE (v3.0).FINDINGS: "FINDINGS" 44 Patients enrolled, 59.1% men, median age 60 years (range 32-76). 70.5% carcinoid tumours, 29.5% pancreatic tumour. Baseline target lesions mainly in the liver (86.4%). Global PFSR was 90.9% (91.7% carcinoid tumours and 88.9% pancreatic tumours). Median PFS was 12.4 months, median TTP was 14.5 months, ORR was 9.4% and DCR was 95.1%. Most common grade 3-4 toxicities: asthenia (11.4%) and hand-foot skin reaction (15.9%).INTERPRETATION: "INTERPRETATION" Sorafenib and bevacizumab combination showed clinical benefit but unfavourable safety results compared with drugs in monotherapy.

S'The aim of this study was to explore the efficacy and toxicities of a combined regimen of bevacizumab plus immunotherapy and chemotherapy (BIC) and the circulating T regulatory cells (Treg) in metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC). Nephrectomized mRCC patients were enrolled into a multicenter single-arm dose-finding study with five escalated dose levels of chemotherapy with intravenous gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil associated with fixed intravenous doses of bevacizumab, subcutaneous low doses of interleukin-2, and interferon-\xce\xb1-2a. An expanded cohort (phase II study) was treated at the recommended dose for additional safety and efficacy information according to minimax Simon two-stage design. Blood samples for Treg were collected and evaluated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis on cycle 1. Fifty-one patients were entered to receive one of five dose levels. Median age was 58 years (male 67 %, pretreated 49 %): 15 patients were low risk according to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) criteria, while 27 and nine were respectively intermediate- and high-risk patients. More frequent grade 3 and 4 toxicities included nonfebrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and fever. Among patients evaluable for response (49), 29.5 % had partial response and 37 % stable disease. Overall median time to progression and median overall survival were 8.8 and 22.67 months, respectively. We observed a rapid increase in the percentage of Treg after immunotherapy and a reduction after bevacizumab only in patient who obtained a partial response or stable disease. The BIC was feasible, well tolerated, and shown interesting activity. Further studies are needed to explore if Treg could have a role in clinical response in mRCC treated with bevacizumab.'

S' The Gynecologic Oncology Group conducted this phase 2 trial to estimate the antitumor activity of bevacizumab and to determine the nature and degree of toxicity in patients with recurrent sex cord-stromal tumors of the ovary.METHODS:  A prospective, multi-institutional cooperative group trial was performed in women with recurrent, measurable ovarian stromal tumors. Patients were allowed to have unlimited prior therapy, excluding bevacizumab. Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg was administered intravenously on day 1 of every 21-day cycle until patients developed disease progression or adverse effects that prohibited further treatment. The primary endpoint was the response rate (RR). Inhibin A and B levels were measured before each cycle, and the values were examined in relation to response and progression.RESULTS:  Thirty-six patients were enrolled, and all were eligible and evaluable. Patients received a median of 9 cycles of treatment (range, 2-37 cycles). Six patients (16.7%) had partial responses (90% confidence interval, 7.5%-30.3%), 28 patients (77.8%) had stable disease, and 2 patients (5.6%) had progressive disease. This met the criterion for declaring the regimen active. The median progression-free survival was 9.3 months, and the median overall survival was not reached in during reporting period. Two grade 4 toxicities occurred, including hypertension and proteinuria; and the most common grade 3 toxicities were hypertension (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x895) and pain (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x895). Inhibin A and B values were lower in patients who responded to treatment.S:  Bevacizumab has activity in the treatment of recurrent sex cord-stromal tumors of the ovary, and its toxicity is acceptable. Further investigation is warranted.'

S' The combination of bevacizumab with fluorouracil-based chemotherapy is a standard first-line treatment option in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We studied the efficacy of continuing or reintroducing bevacizumab in combination with second-line chemotherapy after progression to bevacizumab-based first-line therapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  In this phase III study, patients with mCRC treated with fluoropyrimidine-based first-line chemotherapy plus bevacizumab were randomized to receive in second-line mFOLFOX-6 or FOLFIRI (depending on first-line regimen) with or without bevacizumab. The primary end point was progression-free survival. To detect a hazard ratio (HR) for progression of 0.70 with an \xce\xb1 and \xce\xb2 error of 0.05 and 0.20, respectively, 262 patients were required.RESULTS:  In consideration of the results of the ML18147 trial, the study was prematurely stopped. Between April 2008 and May 2012, a total of 185 patients were randomized. Bevacizumab-free interval was longer than 3 months in 43% of patients in chemotherapy alone arm and in 50% of patients in the bevacizumab arm. At a median follow-up of 45.3 months, the median progression-free survival was 5.0 months in the chemotherapy group and 6.8 months in the bevacizumab group [adjusted HR = 0.70; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52-0.95; stratified log-rank P = 0.010]. Subgroup analyses showed a consistent benefit in all subgroups analyzed and in particular in patients who had continued or reintroduced bevacizumab. An improved overall survival was also observed in the bevacizumab arm (adjusted HR = 0.77; 95% CI 0.56-1.06; stratified log-rank P = 0.043). Responses (RECIST 1.0) were similar in the chemotherapy and bevacizumab groups (17% and 21%; P = 0.573). Toxicity profile was consistent with previously reported data.S:  This study demonstrates that the continuation or the reintroduction of bevacizumab with second-line chemotherapy beyond first progression improves the outcome and supports the use of this strategy in the treatment of mCRC.'

S'"" The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of CT perfusion in monitoring response to neoadjuvant antiangiogenic and radiation therapy in resectable soft-tissue sarcomas and correlate the findings with tumor size, circulating and tumor biomarkers, and gene expression.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: "SUBJECTS AND METHODS" This phase II clinical trial included 20 patients (13 men and 7 women; mean age, 55 years) with soft-tissue sarcomas who were undergoing treatment with the antiangiogenic drug bevacizumab followed by bevacizumab, radiation, and surgical resection. The patients underwent CT perfusion and diagnostic contrast-enhanced CT at baseline, at 2 weeks after bevacizumab therapy, and after completion of bevacizumab and radiation therapy. Multiple CT perfusion parameters (blood flow, blood volume, mean transit time, and permeability) were correlated with tumor size, circulating and tumor biomarkers, and gene expression.RESULTS:  Two weeks after bevacizumab therapy, there was substantial fall in blood volume (31.9% reduction, p = 0.01) with more pronounced reduction in blood flow, blood volume, and permeability after treatment completion (53-64% reduction in blood flow, blood volume, and permeability; p = 0.001), whereas tumor size showed no significant change (p = 0.34). Tumors with higher baseline blood volume and lower baseline tumor size showed superior response to bevacizumab and radiation (p = 0.05). There was also an increase in median plasma vascular endothelial growth factor and placental-derived growth factor concentration after bevacizumab therapy paralleled by a decrease in tumor perfusion depicted by CT perfusion, although this was not statistically significant (p = 0.4). The baseline tumor microvessel density (MVD) correlated with blood flow (p = 0.04). At least 20 different genes were differentially expressed in tumors with higher and lower baseline perfusion.: "" CT perfusion is more sensitive than tumor size for monitoring early and late response to bevacizumab and radiation therapy. CT perfusion parameters correlate with MVD, and the gene expression levels of baseline tumors could potentially predict treatment response.'

S' There is an unmet need for predictive markers for the antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We aimed to assess whether the location of the primary tumor is associated with bevacizumab effectiveness when combined with capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CAPEOX) in the first-line treatment of patients with mCRC.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  A cohort of 667 consecutive patients with mCRC from the general community treated from 2006 to 2011 with CAPEOX and bevacizumab as standard first-line therapy was compared with a cohort of 213 patients treated with CAPEOX from 2003 to 2006, before bevacizumab was approved. Main outcome measures were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Differences in outcome were tested using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests, and multivariate analyses were carried out using Cox Proportional Hazards models.RESULTS:  Patients treated with CAPEOX and bevacizumab with primary tumors originating in the sigmoid colon and rectum had a significantly better outcome than patients with primary tumors originating from the cecum to the descending colon, both for PFS (median PFS 9.3 versus 7.2 months; hazard ratio (HR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56-0.82) and for OS (median OS 23.5 versus 13.0 months; HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.38-0.57). This difference was confirmed in multivariate analyses after adjustment for other potentially prognostic factors. For patients treated with CAPEOX, there was no association between primary tumor location and outcome, neither in unadjusted nor adjusted analyses.S:  The addition of bevacizumab to CAPEOX in first-line treatment of patients with mCRC may primarily benefit patients with primary tumors originating in the rectum and sigmoid colon. This hypothesis needs to be validated in data from completed randomized trials.'

S' To determine the maximal tolerated dose of erlotinib when added to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chemoradiation and bevacizumab and safety and efficacy of this combination in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Patients with Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasound defined T3 or T4 adenocarcinoma of the rectum and without evidence of metastatic disease were enrolled. Patients received infusional 5-FU 225 mg/M2/day continuously, along with bevacizumab 5 mg/kg days 14, 1, 15 and 29. Standard radiotherapy was administered to 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. Erlotinib started at a dose of 50 mg orally daily and advanced by 50 mg increments in the subsequent cohort. Open total mesorectal excision was carried out 6-9 weeks following the completion of chemoradiation.RESULTS:  Thirty-two patients received one of three dose levels of erlotinib. Erlotinib dose level of 100 mg was determined to be the maximally tolerated dose. Thirty-one patients underwent resection of the primary tumor, one refused resection. Twenty-seven patients completed study therapy, all of whom underwent resection. At least one grade 3-4 toxicity occurred in 46.9% of patients. Grade 3-4 diarrhea occurred in 18.8%. The pathologic complete response (pCR) for all patients completing study therapy was 33%. With a median follow-up of 2.9 years, there are no documented local recurrences. Disease-free survival at 3 years is 75.5% (confidence interval: 55.1-87.6%).S:  Erlotinib added to infusional 5-FU, bevacizumab and radiation in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer is relatively well tolerated and associated with an encouraging pCR.'

S' Efficacy and safety of first-line axitinib/paclitaxel/carboplatin versus bevacizumab/paclitaxel/carboplatin in advanced non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was evaluated.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Patients with stage IIIB/IV disease stratified by adjuvant therapy and gender were randomised 1 : 1 to axitinib (5 mg twice daily) or bevacizumab [15 mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W)], both with paclitaxel (200 mg/m(2) Q3W)/carboplatin (AUC 6 mg min/ml Q3W).RESULTS:  The trial was discontinued after preliminary analysis. Median progression-free survival (primary end point) for axitinib (N = 58) and bevacizumab (N = 60), respectively, was 5.7 and 6.1 months [hazard ratio (HR) 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68-1.76; one-sided stratified P = 0.64]; median overall survival was 10.6 and 13.3 months (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.74-1.69; one-sided stratified P = 0.70). Objective response rates (95% CI) were 29.3% (18.1-42.7) and 43.3% (30.6-56.8), respectively; risk ratio 0.676 (95% CI 0.41-1.11; one-sided stratified P = 0.94). The most common grade 3/4 adverse events included neutropenia (28% versus 20%), fatigue (14% versus 7%), and hypertension (14% versus 5%). Patient-reported outcomes based on the EORTC QLQ-C30 were similar between arms.S:  In patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC, axitinib/paclitaxel/carboplatin did not improve efficacy versus bevacizumab/paclitaxel/carboplatin, and was less well tolerated.'

S' The main objective was to study the effect on progression-free survival (PFS) of adding erlotinib to bevacizumab as maintenance treatment following chemotherapy and bevacizumab as first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Patients with untreated mCRC received doublet chemotherapy + bevacizumab during 18 weeks and those without tumor progression were eligible for randomization to bevacizumab + erlotinib (arm A) or bevacizumab alone (arm B), until progression or unacceptable toxic effect.RESULTS:  Of the 249 patients enrolled, 80 started maintenance treatment in arm A and 79 in arm B. The rate of any grade 3/4 toxic effect was 53% in arm A and 13% in arm B. Median PFS was 5.7 months in arm A and 4.2 months in arm B (HR = 0.79; 95% confidence interval 0.55-1.12; P = 0.19). Overall survival (OS) from start of induction chemotherapy was 26.7 months in the randomized population, with no difference between the two arms.S:  The addition of erlotinib to bevacizumab as maintenance treatment after first-line chemotherapy in mCRC did not improve PFS significantly.

Toxicity, PFS and overall survival were secondary endpoints. Eligible pts had advanced HCC, Child Pugh A liver status and no prior systemic therapy involving the VEGF or m-TOR targeted agents. Patients were treated with temsirolimus 25 mg IV on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28 day cycle and bevacizumab 10 mg/kg IV on Days 1 and 15 of the cycle.RESULTS:  Twenty-eight eligible patients were enrolled, 26 evaluable receiving a median of 6.5 cycles (range 1-18). Drug related toxicities were common including cytopenias, fatigue, mucositis, diarrhea and mild bleeds. Dose reductions or discontinuation of TEM were common. Accrual closed for presumed futility after interim analysis of the first 25 evaluable patients showed only one PR and 16/25 were progression-free at 6 months. However, the final data update in March 2013 demonstrated 4 confirmed PRs, a 5th unconfirmed PR and 16 /26 progression-free at 6 months.

S' Dose intense chemotherapy may improve efficacy with acceptable toxicity. A phase II study was conducted to determine the feasibility of a dose-intense two weekly schedule of capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).METHODS:  49 patients with previously untreated mCRC were recruited. Nineteen received capecitabine (1750 mg/m(2) oral BD days 1-7)oxaliplatin (85 mg/m(2)i.v. day 1) and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg i.v. day 1) using a 14-day cycle (C1750). Following toxicity concerns capecitabine was reduced to 1500 mg/m2oral BD (C1500) and 30 further patients recruited.RESULTS:  Over 80% of patients received at least 75% of planned chemotherapy doses over the first two cycles. At C1750 Grade 3 or higher toxicity occurred in 74% (95% CI 49% to 91%) and on C1500 in 70% (95% CI 51% to 85%). The median progression-free survival was 6.9 months (95% CI 4.7 to 8.7) for C1750 dose and 8.9 months (95% CI 4.1 to 12.4) for C1500. 3 treatment-related deaths occurred.S:  Dose intense capecitabine and oxaliplatin with bevacizumab does not show additional efficacy and has potentially significant toxicity.

S'"AIM" To evaluate efficacy and safety of intravitreal aflibercept injection (IAI) in subjects who were previously treated with ranibizumab and/or bevacizumab for active exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD).METHODS:  Patients (n=26) were enrolled in a 12-month prospective, interventional, single arm, investigator-initiated study with planned 6-month interim analysis. Patients with active exudative AMD, previously treated with ranibizumab and/or bevacizumab, were treated with 2\xe2\x80\x85mg IAI every month for the first 3\xe2\x80\x85months, followed by a fixed dosing schedule of 2\xe2\x80\x85mg IAI every 2\xe2\x80\x85months. The primary study endpoint was the mean absolute change from baseline central subfield thickness (CST) at month 12 as measured by SDOCT. Secondary outcomes included mean change from baseline best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) score, percentage of subjects who gained or lost greater than or equal to 15 letters of vision, percentage of subjects who are 20/40 or better, percentage of subjects who are 20/200 or worse, and the incidence of adverse events (AE) and serious AEs.RESULTS:  Planned 6-month interim analysis demonstrated a mean decrease in CST of 38.6\xe2\x80\x85\xc2\xb5m (p<0.001) and a mean increase in ETDRS BCVA of +5.9 letters (p<0.001). Fifteen percent of subjects experienced a greater than 15-letter improvement in visual acuity, 84.6% of patients gained visual acuity, and no patient lost 3 lines of vision from baseline. Forty-two percent of subjects were 20/40 or better, and 11.5% of subjects were 20/200 or worse at month 6.

S' The aim of this randomized, phase II trial was to explore the activity and safety of adding bevacizumab to paclitaxel once per week in treatment of angiosarcomas (AS).METHODS:  Patients were treated with paclitaxel alone (90 mg/m(2) per week for six cycles of 28 days each; arm A) or with paclitaxel combined with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg once every 2 weeks; arm B). In the combination treatment arm, bevacizumab was administered after the six cycles of chemotherapy as maintenance therapy (15 mg/kg once every 3 weeks) until intolerance or progression occurred. Stratification factors were superficial versus visceral AS and de novo versus radiation-induced AS. The primary end point was the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate, which was based on RECIST, version 1.1. Statistical assumptions were P0 = 20%, P1 = 40%, a = 10%, and b = 20%. P0 was the PFS rate at 6 months defining inactive drug, and P1 was the PFS rate at 6 months defining promising drug.RESULTS:  A total of 52 patients were enrolled, and 50 were randomly assigned in 14 centers. The most common primary sites were the breast (49%) and skin (12%). There were 17 (34%) visceral and 24 (49%) radiation-induced AS.

S' We assessed the activity and toxicity of the XELBEVOCT regimen in patients with metastatic well-to-moderately differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms (WMD-NEN). Ancillary studies evaluated hypertension, proteinuria, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) polymorphisms in predicting progression-free survival (PFS) and the predictive role of serum vitamin D in progression-free survival and proteinuria onset.METHODS:  This prospective phase 2 study included 45 patients with WMD-NEN arising from various primary sites. The treatment regimen was octreotide long-acting release (LAR), 20 mg monthly, metronomic capecitabine, 2000 mg/daily, and intravenous bevacizumab, 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks, without interruption for 9 months. Bevacizumab was continued until disease progression.RESULTS:  Partial response was obtained in 8 patients (17.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.4%-28.2%); tumor response was more frequent in pancreatic than in non-pancreatic malignancies. The median PFS was 14.9 months; median overall survival was not attained. Biochemical and symptomatic responses were observed in 52.9% and 82.3% of cases, respectively. The treatment was well tolerated. Grade 3 toxicities included hand and foot syndrome (11.1%), proteinuria (4.4%), and renal toxicity (2.2%). Proteinuria (all grades) was correlated with longer PFS (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.017). There was an inverse relationship between proteinuria and vitamin D levels. VEGF polymorphisms were not associated with patient outcome.: "" The XELBEVOCT regimen is active and well tolerated in patients with metastatic WMD-NEN.

S' Preoperative treatment of resectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC) is a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and activity of bevacizumab plus FOLFIRI in this setting.METHODS:  Patients aged 18-75 years, PS 0-1, with resectable liver-confined metastases from CRC were eligible. They received bevacizumab 5 mg kg(-1) followed by irinotecan 180 mg m(-)(2), leucovorin 200 mg m(-)(2), 5-fluorouracil 400 mg m(-)(2) bolus and 5-fluorouracil 2400 mg m(-)(2) 46-h infusion, biweekly, for 7 cycles. Bevacizumab was stopped at cycle 6. A single-stage, single-arm phase 2 study design was applied with 1-year progression-free rate as the primary end point, and 39 patients required.RESULTS:  From October 2007 to December 2009, 39 patients were enrolled in a single institution. Objective response rate was 66.7% (95% exact CI: 49.8-80.9). Of these, 37 patients (94.9%) underwent surgery, with a R0 rate of 84.6%. Five patients had a pathological complete remission (14%). Out of 37 patients, 16 (43.2%) had at least one surgical complication (most frequently biloma). At 1 year of follow-up, 24 patients were alive and free from disease progression (61.6%, 95% CI: 44.6-76.6).

S'Glioblastoma has a poor prognosis accompanied by debilitating neurological symptoms and impaired quality of life. Effective treatment strategies are needed, beyond the current standard of care (SOC), to improve outcomes. Glioblastomas are highly vascularized with elevated levels of VEGF, representing an appropriate target for selective therapies. The role of the anti-VEGF agent bevacizumab in newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma is not fully clear at this time. Although bevacizumab has demonstrated improvements in progression-free survival in newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma, there remain challenges in assessing disease progression after antiangiogenic treatment. The bevacizumab mechanism of action suggests a rationale for continuing bevacizumab treatment through multiple lines of therapy, strengthened by longer progression-free and overall survival observed with bevacizumab continuation beyond progression in a Phase III study in metastatic colorectal cancer and in pooled analyses of Phase II trials in glioblastoma. A novel study (randomized, double-blind, Phase IIIb; TAMIGA [MO28347]) aims to evaluate whether continuing bevacizumab plus lomustine (as second-line therapy) and SOC (third line and beyond) improves survival compared with placebo plus lomustine and then placebo plus SOC in patients with glioblastoma who progressed after first-line bevacizumab plus SOC.

S' Patients with a newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) have a high risk of recurrent disease with a dismal outcome despite intensive treatment of sequential surgery and chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ), followed by TMZ as a single agent. Bevacizumab (BV) may increase response rates to chemotherapy in the recurrent treatment setting of GBM. We hypothesized that a neoadjuvant treatment strategy for patients with newly diagnosed GBM using chemoradiotherapy plus BV would improve resectability and thus survival. We performed a phase II trial of the treatment strategy of BV plus chemoradiation to determine the safety of this combination in patients who had already undergone primary surgery for their GBM.METHODS:  After a biopsy (6 patients) or a resection (13 patients) of a newly diagnosed GBM, 19 patients received radiotherapy (30 fractions of 2 Gy) in combination with daily TMZ 75 mg/m(2) and BV 10 mg/kg on days 1, 14, and 28, followed by 6 monthly cycles of TMZ 150-200 mg/m(2) on days 1-5.RESULTS:  The overall response rate was 26%. Three patients had a complete response after resection, and in two patients, a complete response after resection followed by chemoradiation plus BV was seen. No grade 3-4 toxicities were observed during combination treatment. The median progression-free survival was 9.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.3-14.4 months). The median overall survival was 16 months (95% CI: 8.1-26.3 months), similar to a matched control group that received standard chemoradiotherapy from our institution.: "" Combination of bevacizumab with radiotherapy and TMZ is safe and feasible in patients with newly diagnosed GBM, but because of low response rates, this treatment strategy does not favor a neoadjuvant approach.'

S' Second-line treatment with chemotherapy and anti-epidermal growth factor receptor or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies improves outcomes in patients with wild type Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The choice of biological agent in second-line mCRC remains unclear. In this randomized, phase II estimation trial, we compared FOLFIRI (irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil, and leucovorin) in combination with panitumumab or bevacizumab in patients with disease progression during oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy and bevacizumab.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  One hundred eighty-two patients were randomized to FOLFIRI with panitumumab or bevacizumab. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.RESULTS:  PFS was similar between arms, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.01 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68-1.50; P = .97). Median PFS was 7.7 months (95% CI, 5.7-11.8) in the panitumumab arm and 9.2 months (95% CI, 7.8-10.6) in the bevacizumab arm. OS was also similar between arms, with an HR of 1.06 (95% CI, 0.75-1.49; P = .75).

This study investigated the correlation of the clinical benefits and prognosis with proteinuria and other parameters.METHODS:  The study included mCRC patients receiving bevacizumab. Hypertension, 24-hour urine proteinuria, and other routine parameters were recorded at baseline and at certain intervals during treatment.RESULTS:  The study included 36 consecutive patients. The median progression-free survival (PFS) duration was 10.9\xc2\xb12.6months, and the median overall survival (OS) was 23\xc2\xb13.1months.

Dose-limiting toxicities, adverse events (AEs), maximum tolerated dose, and response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors were assessed.RESULTS:  In the first cohort (3 patients given dulanermin at 4.5 mg/kg/d) and second cohort (6 patients given dulanermin at 9 mg/kg/day), no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The subsequent 14 patients were treated with a dulanermin dosage of 9 mg/kg/d. Patients (N = 23) received 2 to 42 cycles of dulanermin (median 15). The most common grade 3 or 4 AEs were neutropenia (39%), hypertension (17%), peripheral neuropathy (17%), hand-foot syndrome (13%), and pulmonary embolism (13%). Three patients (13%) discontinued the study because of serious AEs. Overall, a best response of partial response was observed in 13 patients (57%) (9 confirmed, 4 unconfirmed), stable disease was observed in 7 patients (30%), and disease progression was observed in 3 patients (13%).

The injection response patterns were classified based on the specific time point at which the macula was first defined as \'dry\'.RESULTS:  Eyes with better baseline visual acuity less frequently had persistent oedema and had fewer recurrences in the second year. All eyes with baseline subretinal detachment showed persistent macular oedema at 24 months. None of the other factors assessed influenced injection frequency or response in the first or second year.S:  Good long-term response is predicted by resolution of macular oedema by 4 months. However, approximately 20% of patients with persistent oedema at 12 months achieved a dry macula and 50% gained more than 15 letters at 24 months with sustained treatment, suggesting that oedema at 4 or 12 months should not be used as a stopping criterion for treatment.'

Outcomes were best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT), and intraocular pressure (IOP) changes.RESULTS:  Mean BCVA improved significantly at 6 months in both groups; from 0.87 \xc2\xb1 0.49 to 0.41 \xc2\xb1 0.35 logMAR in IVB group, and from 0.81 \xc2\xb1 0.45 to 0.62 \xc2\xb1 0.48 logMAR in IVT group (p < 0.001). However, between-group differences reach a significant level at months 4 (p = 0.003) and 6 (p < 0.001) in favour of the IVB group. In terms of CMT reduction, the difference between the groups was statistically significant (p = 0.002) at month 6. Significant differences were noted more in the ischaemic cases in favour of the IVB group. Mean IOP rise was significantly higher in the IVT group at all visits.S:  Both 3-times monthly IVB injections and 2-times IVT injections could be effective in cases with recent onset CRVO up to 6 months. However, considering the better outcomes after IVB injections and the potential complications of IVT injections, we would recommend prescheduled repeated IVB injections for such cases.

All of the 66 operated patients had a R0 resection. 47 patients (68.1%) underwent sphincter preserving surgery.S:  The addition of bevacizumab and oxaliplatin to RCT with capecitabine was well tolerated and did not increase perioperative morbidity or mortality. However, the pCR rate was not improved in comparison to other trials that used capecitabine or capecitabine/oxaliplatin in preoperative radiochemotherapy.'

S'"" It was the aim of this study to evaluate maintenance therapy with bevacizumab + capecitabine following induction with bevacizumab + capecitabine + oxaliplatin (XELOX) versus bevacizumab + XELOX until progression as first-line therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).METHODS:  Patients received either bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg) + XELOX (capecitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1-14 + oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2) on day 1 every 3 weeks) until disease progression (arm A) or the same doses of bevacizumab + XELOX for 6 cycles followed by bevacizumab + capecitabine until disease progression (arm B). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR) and safety.RESULTS:  One hundred and twenty-three patients were randomized. Treatment compliance was similar in both groups. Median PFS was significantly longer for arm B than for arm A (11.0 vs. 8.3 months; p = 0.002). There was no significant difference between the two arms for ORR (66.7 vs. 59.0%; p = 0.861) or median OS (23.8 vs. 20.2 months; p = 0.100). Tolerability was acceptable in both treatment arms; the most frequent grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events (arm B vs. arm A) were fatigue (6.6 vs. 16.1%), diarrhoea (3.3 vs. 11.3%), anorexia (3.3 vs. 11.3%), and neuropathy (1.6 vs. 8.1%).S:  Maintenance therapy with bevacizumab + capecitabine can be considered an appropriate option following induction bevacizumab + XELOX in patients with mCRC instead of continuation of bevacizumab + XELOX.'

S'We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of combining trastuzumab/vinorelbine with bevacizumab in patients with first-or second-line HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Eligible patients had HER2-positive measureable MBC, with no more than one prior line of chemotherapy, and were treated with trastuzumab (4 mg/kg \xc3\x97 2 mg/kg weekly thereafter), vinorelbine (25 mg/m(2) weekly), and bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks). Co-primary endpoints were (a) the proportion of patients alive and progression-free at 1 year and (b) safety profile/feasibility. Feasibility was defined as a rate of grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicity attributable to protocol-based therapy <20 %. Twenty-nine patients were enrolled (n = 22 first-line, n = 7 second-line). Median age was 48 years (range 37-68). The median number of cycles received was 8 (1-23) and median duration on treatment was 7.4 months (range 1-22). The study was closed early due to higher-than-expected rates of grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicities, with 50 events in 20 patients. A total of six patients (21 %) were taken off study for treatment-related toxicity. Most common treatment-related toxicities included fatigue (n = 7), febrile neutropenia (n = 4), and headache (n = 3). At 1 year, 8/22 first-line (36 %) and 2/7 second-line (29 %) patients were alive and progression-free. Median PFS was 9.9 months and 7.8 months in the first- and second-line cohorts, respectively. Objective responses were observed in 16/22 (73 %) and 5/7 (71 %) patients in the first- and second-line settings. Although the combination of vinorelbine, trastuzumab, and bevacizumab showed notable activity in HER2-positive MBC, the proportion of first-line patients alive and progression-free at 1 year was deemed unlikely to reach the pre-defined threshold for declaring success. Additionally, unacceptable toxicity was observed, at rates greater than previously reported with vinorelbine/trastuzumab or vinorelbine/bevacizumab doublet combinations.'

Ranibizumab was significantly more costly than bevacizumab for both continuous (+\xc2\xa314\xe2\x80\x85989/patient ($23\xe2\x80\x85468); 95% CI \xc2\xa314\xe2\x80\x85522 to \xc2\xa315\xe2\x80\x85456; p<0.001) and discontinuous treatment (+\xc2\xa38498 ($13\xe2\x80\x85305); 95% CI \xc2\xa37700 to \xc2\xa39295; p<0.001), with negligible difference in QALYs. Continuous ranibizumab would only be cost-effective compared with continuous bevacizumab if the NHS were willing to pay \xc2\xa33.5 million ($5.5 million) per additional QALY gained. Patients receiving continuous bevacizumab accrued higher total costs (+\xc2\xa3599 ($938); 95% CI \xc2\xa391 to \xc2\xa31107; p=0.021) than those receiving discontinuous bevacizumab, but also accrued non-significantly more QALYs (+0.020; 95% CI -0.032 to 0.071; p=0.452). Continuous bevacizumab therefore cost \xc2\xa330\xe2\x80\x85220 ($47\xe2\x80\x85316) per QALY gained versus discontinuous bevacizumab. However, bootstrapping demonstrated that if the NHS is willing to pay \xc2\xa320\xe2\x80\x85000/QALY gained, there is a 37% chance that continuous bevacizumab is cost-effective versus discontinuous bevacizumab.S:  Ranibizumab is not cost-effective compared with bevacizumab, being substantially more costly and producing little or no QALY gain. Discontinuous bevacizumab is likely to be the most cost-effective of the four treatment strategies evaluated in this UK trial, although there is a 37% chance that continuous bevacizumab is cost-effective.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: "TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER" ISRCTN92166560.'

S' To test whether combining bevacizumab, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment, with endocrine therapy (ET) could potentially delay the emergence of resistance to ET.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  A multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase III, binational (Spain and Germany) study added bevacizumab (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks) to ET (ET-B; letrozole or fulvestrant) as first-line therapy in postmenopausal patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -negative and hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer. We compared progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), response duration (RD), time to treatment failure (TTF), clinical benefit rate (CBR), and safety.RESULTS:  From 380 patients recruited (2007 to 2011), 374 were analyzed by intent to-treat (184 patients on ET and 190 patients on ET-B). Median age was 65 years, 270 patients (72%) had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0, 178 patients (48%) had visceral metastases, and 171 patients (46%) and 195 patients (52%) had received prior chemotherapy or ET, respectively. Median PFS was 14.4 months in the ET arm and 19.3 months in the ET-B arm (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.06; P = .126). ORR, CBR, and RD with ET versus ET-B were 22% versus 41% (P < .001), 67% versus 77% (P = .041), and 13.3 months versus 17.6 months (P = .434), respectively. TTF and OS were comparable in both arms. Grade 3 to 4 hypertension, aminotransferase elevation, and proteinuria were significantly higher in the ET-B arm. Eight patients (4.2%) receiving ET-B died during study or within 30 days of end of treatment.: "" The addition of bevacizumab to ET in first-line treatment failed to produce a statistically significant increase in PFS or OS in women with HER2-negative/hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer.'

S' Bevacizumab or temsirolimus regimens have clinical activity in the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). This phase I/II trial was conducted to determine the safety of combining both agents and its efficacy in RCC patients who progressed on at least one prior anti-VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKI) agent.METHODS:  In the phase I portion, eligible patients were treated with temsirolimus (25\xc2\xa0mg IV weekly) and escalating doses of IV bevacizumab (level 1\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa05\xc2\xa0mg/kg; level 2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa010\xc2\xa0mg/kg) every other week. The primary endpoint for the phase II portion (RTKI resistant patients) was the 6-month progression-free rate. Secondary endpoints were response rate, toxicity evaluation, and PFS and OS.RESULTS:  Maximum tolerated dose was not reached at the maximum dose administered in 12 phase I patients. Forty evaluable patients were treated with the phase II recommended dose (temsirolimus 25\xc2\xa0mg IV weekly and bevacizumab 10\xc2\xa0mg/kg IV every 2\xc2\xa0weeks). The 6-month progression-free rate was 40\xc2\xa0% (16/40 pts). Median PFS was 5.9 (4-7.8) months, and median OS was 20.6 (11.5-23.7)\xc2\xa0months. Partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease were seen in 23, 63, and 14\xc2\xa0% of patients, respectively. Most common grade 3-4 AEs included fatigue (17.8\xc2\xa0%), hypertriglyceridemia (11.1\xc2\xa0%), stomatitis (8.9\xc2\xa0%), proteinuria (8.9\xc2\xa0%), abdominal pain (6.7\xc2\xa0%), and anemia (6.7\xc2\xa0%). Baseline levels of serum sFLT-1 and VEGF-A were inversely correlated with PFS and OS, respectively.S:  Temsirolimus and bevacizumab is a feasible combination in patients with advanced RCC previously exposed to oral anti-VEGF agents. The safety and efficacy results warrant further confirmatory studies in this patient population.'

S' Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-P) and bevacizumab have each demonstrated efficacy in patients with MBC. This trial was designed to further develop nab-P by evaluating its efficacy and safety using every 3 weeks (q3w), every 2 weeks (q2w), or weekly scheduling in combination with bevacizumab as first-line treatment of MBC.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  This open-label phase II study randomized patients to nab-P 260 mg/m(2) q3w (arm A) vs. 260 mg/m(2) q2w with filgrastim (arm B) vs. 130 mg/m(2) weekly uninterrupted, all with bevacizumab (15 mg/kg q3w arm A, 10 mg/kg q2w arms B and C). The primary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR) and toxicity. Time to tumor progression (TTP) and overall survival were secondary endpoints.RESULTS:  Of 212 patients randomized, 208 (arm A, 75; arm B, 54; arm C, 79) were treated. Arm B was closed early due to toxicity, with more grade \xe2\x89\xa5 2 fatigue (arm A, 46%; arm B, 62%; arm C, 62%) and bone pain (arm A, 11%; arm B, 23%; arm C, 5%). Neurotoxicity grade \xe2\x89\xa5 2 was equivalent across the arms (> 50%) and reversible for most patients. Febrile neutropenia occurred in \xe2\x89\xa4 3% of patients in all arms. ORR was similar among the arms (arm A, 45%; arm B, 41%; arm C, 46%). Median TTP was slightly longer in arm C (9.0 months) vs. arms A (8.0 months) and B (5.8 months) (overall, P = .105).S:  Significant antitumor activity was observed in all the arms. Weekly nab-P with bevacizumab appeared to have the highest therapeutic index. However, sensory neuropathy was treatment limiting, which suggests that a 3 weeks on and 1 week off schedule should be explored.'

S' To compare the short term effects of bevacizumab and ranibizumab injections on the regression of corneal neovascularization (NV).METHODS:  Sixteen eyes of 16 patients with corneal NV were randomly assigned for an injection with 2.5 mg of bevacizumab (group 1, n = 8) or 1 mg of ranibizumab (group 2, n = 8) through subconjunctival and intrastromal routes. The patients were prospectively followed-up for one month after the injections. Corneal NV areas, as shown on corneal slit-lamp photographs stored in JPEG format, were calculated using Image J software before the injection, one week after the injection, and one month after the injection. The corneal NV areas were compared before and after the injections.RESULTS:  Seven women and nine men, with an average age of 51 years, presented with corneal NV secondary to herpetic keratitis (7 cases), graft rejection (6), chemical burn (1), pemphigoid (1), and recurrent ulcer (1). In group I, the preoperative corneal NV area (8.75 \xc2\xb1 4.33%) was significantly decreased to 5.62 \xc2\xb1 3.86% one week after the injection and to 6.35 \xc2\xb1 3.02% one month after the injection (p = 0.012, 0.012, respectively). The corneal NV area in group 2 also exhibited a significant change, from 7.37 \xc2\xb1 4.33% to 6.72 \xc2\xb1 4.16% one week after the injection (p = 0.012). However, no significant change was observed one month after the injection. The mean decrease in corneal NV area one month after injection in group 1 (28.4 \xc2\xb1 9.01%) was significantly higher than in group 2 (4.51 \xc2\xb1 11.64%, p = 0.001).S:  Bevacizumab injection resulted in a more effective and stable regression of corneal NV compared to the ranibizumab injection.

Eligible patients had predominantly clear cell metastatic RCC, measurable disease, a Karnofsky Performance Status of \xe2\x89\xa580%, and adequate end-organ function. IL-2 (600,000 IU/kg) was infused intravenously every 8 hours (maximum 28 doses) during two 5-day cycles on days 1 and 15 of each 84-day course. Bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) was infused intravenously every 2 weeks beginning 2 weeks before initiating IL-2. Fifty of 51 eligible patients from 8 centers were enrolled. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 11.2 months (90% confidence interval, 5.7-17.7), and 2-year PFS was 18% (90% confidence interval, 8%-27%). Responses included 4 complete (8%) and 11 partial (22%) responses. Toxicities did not exceed those expected from each agent alone. Combining IL-2 plus bevacizumab is feasible, with a response rate and PFS at least as high as reported previously for the single agents.

The completion rate of the scheduled chemotherapy was 91%. Reasons for withdrawal were refusal to continue therapy in two patients and disease progression in one, with two of these three patients not undergoing surgery. Among the 29 patients who completed the scheduled chemotherapy, one refused surgery within 8 weeks after the completion of chemotherapy, which was the period stipulated by the protocol, and another had rectal perforation, requiring urgent laparotomy. As a result, the completion rate of this experimental treatment was 84%. Of the 30 patients who underwent surgery, the R0 resection rate was 90% and a postoperative complication occurred in 43%. A pathological complete response was observed in 13% and good tumor regression was exhibited in 37%.S:  Neoadjuvant oxaliplatin and capecitabine plus bevacizumab for poor-risk rectal cancer caused a high rate of anastomotic leakage and experienced a case with perforation during chemotherapy, both of which were bevacizumab-related toxicity.

S' Treatment options for recurrent glioblastoma are scarce, with second-line chemotherapy showing only modest activity against the tumour. Despite the absence of well controlled trials, bevacizumab is widely used in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma. Nonetheless, whether the high response rates reported after treatment with this drug translate into an overall survival benefit remains unclear. We report the results of the first randomised controlled phase 2 trial of bevacizumab in recurrent glioblastoma.METHODS:  The BELOB trial was an open-label, three-group, multicentre phase 2 study undertaken in 14 hospitals in the Netherlands. Adult patients (\xe2\x89\xa518 years of age) with a first recurrence of a glioblastoma after temozolomide chemoradiotherapy were randomly allocated by a web-based program to treatment with oral lomustine 110 mg/m(2) once every 6 weeks, intravenous bevacizumab 10 mg/kg once every 2 weeks, or combination treatment with lomustine 110 mg/m(2) every 6 weeks and bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Randomisation of patients was stratified with a minimisation procedure, in which the stratification factors were centre, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and age. The primary outcome was overall survival at 9 months, analysed by intention to treat. A safety analysis was planned after the first ten patients completed two cycles of 6 weeks in the combination treatment group. This trial is registered with the Nederlands Trial Register (www.trialregister.nl, number NTR1929).FINDINGS: "FINDINGS" Between Dec 11, 2009, and Nov 10, 2011, 153 patients were enrolled. The preplanned safety analysis was done after eight patients had been treated, because of haematological adverse events (three patients had grade 3 thrombocytopenia and two had grade 4 thrombocytopenia) which reduced bevacizumab dose intensity; the lomustine dose in the combination treatment group was thereafter reduced to 90 mg/m(2). Thus, in addition to the eight patients who were randomly assigned to receive bevacizumab plus lomustine 110 mg/m(2), 51 patients were assigned to receive bevacizumab alone, 47 to receive lomustine alone, and 47 to receive bevacizumab plus lomustine 90 mg/m(2). Of these patients, 50 in the bevacizumab alone group, 46 in the lomustine alone group, and 44 in the bevacizumab and lomustine 90 mg/m(2) group were eligible for analyses. 9-month overall survival was 43% (95% CI 29-57) in the lomustine group, 38% (25-51) in the bevacizumab group, 59% (43-72) in the bevacizumab and lomustine 90 mg/m(2) group, 87% (39-98) in the bevacizumab and lomustine 110 mg/m(2) group, and 63% (49-75) for the combined bevacizumab and lomustine groups. After the reduction in lomustine dose in the combination group, the combined treatment was well tolerated. The most frequent grade 3 or worse toxicities were hypertension (13 [26%] of 50 patients in the bevacizumab group, three [7%] of 46 in the lomustine group, and 11 [25%] of 44 in the bevacizumab and lomustine 90 mg/m(2) group), fatigue (two [4%], four [9%], and eight [18%]), and infections (three [6%], two [4%], and five [11%]). At the time of this analysis, 144/148 (97%) of patients had died and three (2%) were still on treatment.INTERPRETATION: "INTERPRETATION" The combination of bevacizumab and lomustine met prespecified criteria for assessment of this treatment in further phase 3 studies. However, the results in the bevacizumab alone group do not justify further studies of this treatment.FUNDING: "FUNDING" Roche Nederland and KWF Kankerbestrijding.'

S'Targeting multiple regulators of tumor angiogenesis have the potential to improve treatment efficacy. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against vascular endothelial growth factor and ABT-510 is a synthetic analog of thrombospondin, an endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor. Dual inhibition may result in additional benefit. We evaluated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the combination of bevacizumab plus ABT-510 in patients with refractory solid tumors. We also explored the effects of these agents on plasma-based biomarkers and wound angiogenesis. Thirty-four evaluable subjects were enrolled and received study drug. Therapy was well tolerated; minimal treatment-related grade 3/4 toxicity was observed. One patient treated at dose level 1 had a partial response and five other patients treated at the recommended phase II dose had prolonged stable disease for more than 1 year. Biomarker evaluation revealed increased levels of D-dimer, von Willebrand factor, placental growth factor, and stromal-derived factor 1 in response to treatment with the combination of bevacizumab and ABT-510. Data suggest that continued evaluation of combination antiangiogenesis therapies may be clinically useful. '

S' Angiogenesis is crucial for glioblastoma growth, and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents are widely used in recurrent glioblastoma patients. The number of circulating endothelial cells (CECs) is a surrogate marker for endothelial damage. We assessed their kinetics and explored their prognostic value in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.METHODS:  In this side study of the BELOB trial, 141 patients with recurrent glioblastoma were randomised to receive single-agent bevacizumab or lomustine, or bevacizumab plus lomustine. Before treatment, after 4 weeks and after 6 weeks of treatment, CECs were enumerated.RESULTS:  The number of CECs increased during treatment with bevacizumab plus lomustine, but not during treatment in the single-agent arms. In patients treated with lomustine single agent, higher absolute CEC numbers after 4 weeks (log\xe2\x82\x81\xe2\x82\x80CEC hazard ratio (HR) 0.41, 95% CI 0.18-0.91) and 6 weeks (log\xe2\x82\x81\xe2\x82\x80CEC HR 0.16, 95% CI 0.05-0.56) of treatment were associated with improved overall survival (OS). Absolute CEC numbers in patients receiving bevacizumab plus lomustine or bevacizumab single agent were not associated with OS.: "" CEC numbers increased during treatment with bevacizumab plus lomustine but not during treatment with either agent alone, suggesting that this combination induced the greatest vascular damage. Although the absolute number of CECs was not associated with OS in patients treated with bevacizumab either alone or in combination, they could serve as a marker in glioblastoma patients receiving lomustine single agent.'

S' Cetuximab and bevacizumab have both been shown to improve outcomes in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer when added to chemotherapy regimens; however, their comparative effectiveness when partnered with first-line fluorouracil, folinic acid, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) is unknown. We aimed to compare these agents in patients with KRAS (exon 2) codon 12/13 wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer.METHODS: In this open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients aged 18-75 years with stage IV, histologically confirmed colorectal cancer, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2, an estimated life expectancy of greater than 3 months, and adequate organ function, from centres in Germany and Austria. Patients were centrally randomised by fax (1:1) to FOLFIRI plus cetuximab or FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab (using permuted blocks of randomly varying size), stratified according to ECOG performance status, number of metastatic sites, white blood cell count, and alkaline phosphatase concentration. The primary endpoint was objective response analysed by intention to treat. The study has completed recruitment, but follow-up of participants is ongoing. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00433927" title="See in ClincalTrials.gov"NCT00433927</a.FINDINGS: "FINDINGS" Between Jan 23, 2007, and Sept 19, 2012, 592 patients with KRAS exon 2 wild-type tumours were randomly assigned and received treatment (297 in the FOLFIRI plus cetuximab group and 295 in the FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab group). 184 (62\xc2\xb70%, 95% CI 56\xc2\xb72-67\xc2\xb75) patients in the cetuximab group achieved an objective response compared with 171 (58\xc2\xb70%, 52\xc2\xb71-63\xc2\xb77) in the bevacizumab group (odds ratio 1\xc2\xb718, 95% CI 0\xc2\xb785-1\xc2\xb764; p=0\xc2\xb718). Median progression-free survival was 10\xc2\xb70 months (95% CI 8\xc2\xb78-10\xc2\xb78) in the cetuximab group and 10\xc2\xb73 months (9\xc2\xb78-11\xc2\xb73) in the bevacizumab group (hazard ratio [HR] 1\xc2\xb706, 95% CI 0\xc2\xb788-1\xc2\xb726; p=0\xc2\xb755); however, median overall survival was 28\xc2\xb77 months (95% CI 24\xc2\xb70-36\xc2\xb76) in the cetuximab group compared with 25\xc2\xb70 months (22\xc2\xb77-27\xc2\xb76) in the bevacizumab group (HR 0\xc2\xb777, 95% CI 0\xc2\xb762-0\xc2\xb796; p=0\xc2\xb7017). Safety profiles were consistent with the known side-effects of the study drugs. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events in both treatment groups were haematotoxicity (73 [25%] of 297 patients in the cetuximab group vs 62 [21%] of 295 patients in the bevacizumab group), skin reactions (77 [26%] vs six [2%]), and diarrhoea (34 [11%] vs 40 [14%]).INTERPRETATION: "INTERPRETATION" Although the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response did not significantly differ between the FOLFIRI plus cetuximab and FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab groups, the association with longer overall survival suggests that FOLFIRI plus cetuximab could be the preferred first-line regimen for patients with KRAS exon 2 wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer.FUNDING: "FUNDING" Merck KGaA.'

S' To assess the effect of intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) on the incidence of postoperative recurrent vitreous hemorrhage (VH) in eyes operated for diabetic VH when injected at the end of the surgery.METHODS:  A prospective, comparative clinical trial was conducted on a consecutive series of patients requiring vitrectomy for diabetic nonclearing VH. Intravitreal bevacizumab (2.5 mg/0.1 mL) was injected at the completion of surgery. Patients underwent best-corrected visual acuity (VA), applanation tonometry, and biomicroscopic anterior and posterior segment evaluation for VH grading. Postoperative visits were performed at the first day, first week, first month, third month, and sixth month. The VH was graded at each visit, and the rate of postoperative VH and VA improvement and potential complications were evaluated and compared between the groups.RESULTS:  A total of 72 eyes of 66 patients were included. Thirty-four eyes were enrolled in the IVB group and 38 eyes were enrolled in the control group. The rate of postoperative VH did not differ significantly between the groups at any postoperative visit (p>0.05). Three eyes (8.8%) in the IVB group and 5 eyes (13.1%) in the control group had postoperative VH throughout the follow-up period and only one eye from each group underwent a second surgery. Postoperative VA significantly increased in both groups but did not differ significantly between the groups at any postoperative visit (p>0.05).S:  Intravitreal bevacizumab does not seem to have any beneficial effect on the incidence of postoperative VH in eyes operated for diabetic VH when injected at the end of surgery.'

There was high concordance between IRC- and INV-determined PD status (77%) and date (73%). Subgroup analyses were consistent with the primary IRC findings. Early and late discontinuation discordance measures showed no evidence of INV bias.: "" IRC analysis confirmed a significant PFS improvement with CP+BEV\xe2\x86\x92BEV vs. CP alone. Concordance was not influenced by extent of residual disease after cytoreductive surgery or initial stage. The IRC size, high participation rate, and strong concordance between IRC and INV assessments suggest that RECIST can be applied objectively in OC studies.'

S'Loss of phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) expression may be prognostic in colorectal cancer (CRC) and may have a correlation with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression via hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) alpha, and the PI3K/mTOR pathways. We therefore have explored the prognostic association of PTEN loss and the potential that PTEN loss may be predictive of outcome with bevacizumab. Patients enrolled in the AGITG MAX trial, a randomized Phase III trial of capecitabine (C) +/- bevacizumab (B) (+/- mitomycin C [M]) with available tissues were analyzed for PTEN expression (loss vs. no loss) as assessed using a Taqman\xc2\xae copy number assay (CNA). Of the original 471 patients enrolled, tissues from 302 (64.1%) patients were analyzed. PTEN loss was observed in 38.7% of patients. There was no relationship between PTEN loss and KRAS or BRAF mutation. PTEN status was not prognostic for progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) in multivariate analyses adjusting for other baseline factors; loss versus no loss PFS hazard ratio (HR) 0.9 (0.7-1.16), OS HR 1.04 (0.79-1.38). PTEN was not prognostic when assessed by KRAS and BRAF status. By using the comparison of C versus CB+CBM, PTEN status was not significantly predictive of the effectiveness of B for PFS or OS. PTEN status was not prognostic for survival in advanced colorectal cancer, irrespective of KRAS or BRAF status. PTEN status did not significantly predict different benefit with bevacizumb therapy. '

S' S-1, a novel oral prodrug of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and irinotecan with or without bevacizumab is known to be effective in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, it is not clear whether S-1 and irinotecan confers benefits compared to 5-FU and leucovorin plus oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) in patients with mCRC. Our aim was to compare the efficacy and safety of these regimens.METHODS:  We analyzed 187 patients with previously untreated mCRC who were enrolled in four phase II studies: SIR (S-1 and irinotecan, n = 40), SIRB (S-1 and irinotecan with bevacizumab, n = 51), FOLFOX (5-FU and leucovorin plus oxaliplatin, n = 46), and STOX (stop-and-go strategy of modified FOLFOX-6 with bevacizumab, n = 50). We evaluated efficacy and safety between SIR/SIRB and FOLFOX/STOX.RESULTS:  Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups composed of SIR/SIRB (n = 91) and FOLFOX/STOX (n = 96). The overall response rates were not significantly different between the two groups (65% in SIR/SIRB vs. 52% in FOLFOX/STOX, p = 0.125). The median progression-free survival was 10.9 months in SIR/SIRB versus 12.1 months in FOLFOX/STOX (p = 0.59). The median overall survival was 27.3 months in SIR/SIRB versus 26.8 months in FOLFOX/STOX (p = 0.97). Gastrointestinal adverse events were the most common toxicities in SIR/SIRB, while neutropenia and sensory neuropathy were the most common toxicities in FOLFOX/STOX.S:  S-1 and irinotecan with or without bevacizumab was well tolerated and showed similar response rates and survival compared to the FOLFOX regimen.

S' The BELOB study, a randomised controlled phase 2 trial comparing lomustine, bevacizumab and combined lomustine and bevacizumab in patients with recurrent glioblastoma, showed that the 9-month overall survival rate was most promising in the combination arm. Here we report the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) results, a secondary trial end-point.METHODS:  HRQoL was measured at baseline and every 6weeks until progression using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) core questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and brain module (QLQ-BN20). HRQoL was assessed over time for five preselected scales (global health (GH), physical (PF) and social functioning (SF), motor dysfunction (MD) and communication deficit (CD)). Moreover, mean changes in HRQoL from baseline until progression were determined.RESULTS:  138/148 patients with at least a baseline HRQoL assessment were analysed. Over time, HRQoL remained relatively stable in all treatment arms for all five scales, at least during the first three treatment cycles. More than half (54-61%) of the patients showed stable (<10 point change) or improved (\xe2\xa9\xbe10 point change) HRQoL during their progression-free time, except for SF (43%), irrespective of treatment arm. Deterioration of mean HRQoL was most profound at disease progression for all scales except SF, which deteriorated earlier in disease course. Compared to baseline, 40% of patients had clinically relevant (\xe2\xa9\xbe10 points) worse GH, PF and SF, while 44% and 31% had increased MD and CD at disease progression, irrespective of treatment arm.S:  Bevacizumab, whether or not in combination with lomustine, did not negatively affect HRQoL in patients treated for recurrent glioblastoma in this randomised study.'

S' Bevacizumab (Avastin\xc2\xae) is as effective as ranibizumab (Lucentis\xc2\xae) in the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). However it has two important structural differences. First, it has two active sites instead of one; second, it retains the Fc portion of the antibody which would be expected to confer a significantly longer half-life. These agents have been associated with systemic complications including strokes, so it is desirable to use the smallest effective dose. Furthermore, the standard dosing regimen requires monthly hospital visits, which present a significant challenge both to the hospital services and to the patients (who are elderly).METHODS/DESIGN: "METHODS/DESIGN" Patients \xe2\x89\xa550\xc2\xa0years who are eligible for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment of nAMD in the NHS, who are either newly referred for treatment or have reactivation of nAMD and who have not received treatment to either eye for the previous six months. We have designed a factorial multi-centre masked randomised controlled trial using bevacizumab as the intervention, with patients randomised to one of four arms: to standard or low dose and to monthly or two-monthly patient review. The aim is to recruit sufficient patients (around 1,000) to obtain 304 patients meeting the endpoint over a four-year period. The primary endpoint is time to treatment failure to be analysed using Cox regression.DISCUSSION: "DISCUSSION" This randomised control trial will show if half dose and two monthly as required is as effective as full dose and monthly regimes. A two monthly as required regimen of Bevacizumab would significantly reduce both the cost and the service delivery burden for the treatment of nAMD while a reduced dose would be expected to enhance the safety profile of this treatment regime.TRIAL REGISTRATION: "TRIAL REGISTRATION" International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number: ISRCTN95654194 , registered on 22 September 2009.'

Patients then received 1 cycle of chemotherapy without bevacizumab followed by ICS. The primary objective was to determine a feasible dosing schedule. Secondary objectives included defining toxicity, response rates based on imaging, and surgical outcomes defined by residual disease following ICS and 30-day postoperative outcomes.RESULTS:  Nine patients were enrolled with a median age of 64 years. There were no dose-limiting toxicities, and weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m was deemed feasible. During chemotherapy treatment, there were a total of 7 attributable grade 3 toxicities, which most commonly included neutropenia and thromboembolism. All patients demonstrated a response on imaging before surgery, with a median reduction in disease of 56.4% (range, 36.9%-100%). Optimal ICS was performed in all patients, and 78% had no gross residual tumor. There were no intraoperative complications; however, 1 patient experienced an anastomotic leak (grade 4) 10 days after surgery requiring repeat operation.S:  A 4-cycle neoadjuvant regimen of carboplatin area under the curve of 5, weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m, and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg for cycles 1 to 3, followed by interval cytoreduction, was feasible.

S' A phase II clinical trial was conducted on colorectal cancer patients with only liver metastases (focal diameter exceeds 5 cm or the number of liver metastases is \xe2\x89\xa55; H2\xc2\xb7H3) to evaluate the liver resection rate and safety after 6 cycles of mFOLFOX6+bevacizumab (BV) therapy.METHODS:  mFOLFOX6+BV therapy was applied for 6 cycles to the patients with H2\xc2\xb7H3 liver only metastasis. Hepatectomy was considered after the sixth cycle as a rule, and was performed if possible. The primary endpoint was the curative hepatectomy rate (R0 resection rate).RESULTS:  Forty-six patients were registered and 45 patients were included in the efficacy analysis. Of the 19 patients rated as unresectable before therapy, 18 completed 6 cycles of mFOLFOX6+BV therapy and subsequently underwent hepatectomy (16 were R0-resected). Of the 26 initially unresectable patients, 6 underwent hepatectomy (4 were RO-resected). The overall R0 resection rate was 44.4% (20/45). Chemotherapy-associated grade 3 or higher adverse events included neutrophil decreased (17.4%) and leukocyte decreased (8.7%), fatigue (6.5%) etc. Only hypertension (6.5%) and venous thromboembolism (2.2%) were BV-associated grade 3 or higher adverse events. Among the 25 patients who underwent hepatectomy, intraoperative/postoperative complications included grade 3 wound infections (2 cases), biloma, delayed wound healing and intraperitoneal abscess (each 1 case).S:  In colorectal cancer patients with liver-only metastases, mFOLFOX6+ BV therapy yielded a high hepatectomy rate and a high percentage of initially unresectable and subsequently resectable cases. The chemotherapy associated adverse events and hepatectomy complications were both within acceptable ranges.'

This phase I/II trial assessed the safety and efficacy of capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) plus bevacizumab and imatinib in the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.METHODS:  Two dose levels (I/II) were defined: capecitabine 850/1000 mg m(-2) twice daily on days 1-14; oxaliplatin 100/130 mg m(-2) on day 1; bevacizumab 7.5 mg kg(-1) on day 1; imatinib 300 mg day(-1) on days 1-21 every 21 days. The primary study endpoint was safety. The phase II secondary endpoint was 6-month progression-free survival (PFS).RESULTS:  Dose level I was chosen for phase II testing because, even though further dose escalation was permitted by the protocol, gastrointestinal toxicities were considered to be clinically significant. A total of 49 patients were evaluated. The 6-month PFS rate was 76%, median PFS was 10.6 months and median overall survival was 23.2 months. Haematological toxicities were generally mild.

S'"LESSONS LEARNED" The 5-year oncologic outcomes from the trial regimen were excellent. However, the neoadjuvant and surgical toxicity of this regimen was significant and was the primary reason for the low compliance with adjuvant systemic therapy.Due to the lack of an improvement in the pathologic complete response rate, the substantial associated toxicity, and the negative phase III trials of adjuvant bevacizumab in colon cancer, this regimen will not be pursued for further study.BACKGROUND:  The addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy improves overall survival for metastatic colorectal cancer. We initiated a phase II trial to evaluate preoperative capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab with radiation therapy (RT) followed by surgery and postoperative 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin (FOLFOX), and bevacizumab for locally advanced rectal cancer. The purpose of this report is to describe the 5-year oncologic outcomes of this regimen.METHODS:  In a phase II Simon two-stage design study, we evaluated preoperative treatment with capecitabine (825 mg/m(2) b.i.d. Monday-Friday), oxaliplatin (50 mg/m(2) weekly), bevacizumab (5 mg/kg on days 1, 15, and 29), and RT (50.4 Gy). Surgery was performed by 8 weeks after RT. Beginning 8-12 weeks after surgery, patients received FOLFOX plus bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) every 2 weeks for 12 cycles (oxaliplatin stopped after 9 cycles). The primary endpoint was a pathologic complete response (path-CR) rate of 30%. Fifty-seven patients with resectable T3/T4 rectal adenocarcinoma were enrolled between 2006 and 2010.RESULTS:  Of 57 enrolled patients, 53 were eligible and included in the analysis. Forty-eight (91%) patients completed preoperative therapy, all of whom underwent curative surgical resection. Nine patients (17%) achieved path-CR. There were 29 worst grade 3 events, 8 worst grade 4 events, and 2 patient deaths, 1 of which was attributed to study therapy. Twenty-six patients (54%) began adjuvant chemotherapy. After a median follow-up period of 41 months, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate for all patients was 80%. Only 2 patients experienced cancer recurrence: 1 distant (liver) and 1 loco-regional (pelvic lymph nodes), respectively. Both of these patients are still alive. The 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 81%.: "" Despite the path-CR primary endpoint of this trial not being reached, the 5-year OS and recurrence-free survival rates were excellent. However, the neoadjuvant and surgical toxicity of this regimen was significant and was the primary reason for the low compliance with adjuvant systemic therapy. Because of the lack of an improvement in the path-CR rate, the substantial associated toxicity, and the negative phase III trials of adjuvant bevacizumab in colon cancer, this regimen will not be pursued for further study.'

S' The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of bevacizumab alone and in combination with cytotoxic therapy on tumour vasculature in osteosarcoma (OS) using DCE-MRI.METHODS:  Six DCE-MRI and three (18)F-FDG PET examinations were scheduled in 42 subjects with newly diagnosed OS to monitor the response to antiangiogenic therapy alone and in combination with cytotoxic therapy before definitive surgery (week 10). Serial DCE-MRI parameters (K(trans), v(p), and v(e)) were examined for correlation with FDG-PET (SUV(max)) and association with drug exposure, and evaluated with clinical outcome.RESULTS:  K(trans) (P=0.041) and v(p) (P=0.001) significantly dropped from baseline at 24 h after the first dose of bevacizumab alone, but returned to baseline by 72\xe2\x80\x89h. Greater exposure to bevacizumab was correlated with larger decreases in v(p) at day 5 (P=0.04) and week 10 (P=0.02). A lower K(trans) at week 10 was associated with greater percent necrosis (P=0.024) and longer event-free survival (P=0.034).S:  This is the first study to demonstrate significant changes of the plasma volume fraction and vascular leakage in OS with bevacizumab alone. The combination of demonstrated associations between drug exposure and imaging metrics, and imaging metrics and patient survival during neoadjuvant therapy, provides a compelling rationale for larger studies using DCE-MRI to assess vascular effects of therapy in OS.'

S' Bevacizumab improves survival in lung adenocarcinomas. The potential anti-tumor benefit of bevacizumab in squamous cell lung cancers (SQCLCs) is unknown because bevacizumab is contraindicated in patients with advanced SQCLC due to an increased risk of hemoptysis. The risk of hemoptysis may be eliminated in patients with resected SQCLCs. We evaluated the safety of adjuvant bevacizumab in patients with resected SQCLCs and other lung cancers at high risk of hemoptysis.METHODS:  As part of a prospective, phase II trial, patients with lung cancers at high risk of hemoptysis (defined by SQCLC histology, tumor near the central blood vessels, or history of hemoptysis) were treated with adjuvant bevacizumab following neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and complete surgical resection. Bevacizumab 15\xc2\xa0mg/kg was given once every 3\xc2\xa0weeks for up to 1\xc2\xa0year. Patients were followed for safety and survival.RESULTS:  Thirteen patients with high-risk features were treated: 7 patients had SQCLC, 3 had central tumors, and 3 had previous hemoptysis. No hemoptysis of any grade was seen following treatment with bevacizumab. Five of 13 patients experienced grade 1 bleeding (epistaxis, gum bleeding). Hypertension and lymphopenia were seen.S:  In a cohort of patients with resected lung cancers at high risk of hemoptysis, including those with SQCLC, treatment with adjuvant bevacizumab did not result in hemoptysis of any grade.'

S' This study aimed to investigate whether targeted retinal photocoagulation (TRP) for nonperfused areas (NPAs) could have a preventive effect on the recurrence of diabetic macular edema (DME) after intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (IVB).METHODS:  Eyes in the IVB group received 1.25 mg IVB, and eyes in the IVB+TRP group received 1.25 mg IVB combined with TRP of NPAs. Two weeks before IVB administration, grid/focal photocoagulation (PC) had been performed in both groups. After IVB treatment, the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT), determined by optical coherence tomography, were measured every month for 6 months.RESULTS:  Fifty-two patients with DME were enrolled and randomized to an IVB group (n = 26) and an IVB+TRP group (n = 26). After IVB, the CRT decreased temporally, and the CRT significantly increased at 2 months and thereafter in the IVB group but did not increase significantly in the IVB+TRP group. Maximum increase in CRT after IVB was significantly correlated with the width of NPAs in the IVB group (P = 0.0368), but not in the IVB+TRP group. Best corrected visual acuity in the IVB+TRP group was significantly better than that in the IVB group 5 and 6 months after treatment (P < 0.05).S:  Targeted retinal photocoagulation for NPAs was effective to maintain the reduced CRT after grid/focal PC and IVB for patients with DME. These results suggest that retinal ischemia is associated with the pathogenesis of recurrence of DME after IVB. ( www.umin.ac.jp/ctr number, UMIN000007566.).'

S'This phase II trial investigated the efficacy of an induction regimen of bevacizumab, capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) followed by maintenance therapy with bevacizumab plus erlotinib as first-line therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer received intravenous bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg plus oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2) on day 1 followed by oral capecitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1-14 every 3 weeks for six cycles. In the absence of disease progression, patients then received bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg every 3 weeks plus oral erlotinib 150 mg once daily. The primary study endpoint was progression-free survival. In the intention-to-treat population (n = 90), the median progression-free survival was 9.2 [95% confidence interval (CI): 7.9-11.9] months, and the median overall survival was 25.8 (95% CI: 18.0-30.9) months. In the patient subpopulation who received both induction and maintenance therapy (n = 52), median progression-free survival was 11.1 (95% CI: 9.0-15.7) months, and the median overall survival was 29.5 (95% CI: 23.7-36.7) months. KRAS status did not predict efficacy. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were diarrhea, asthenia, and neutropenia. XELOX-bevacizumab for 6 cycles followed by bevacizumab-erlotinib maintenance therapy has been shown to be a highly active and well-tolerated first-line regimen in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

In Cycle 2, patients received bevacizumab followed by FOLFIRI. The regimen was in 2-week cycles. The area under-the-curves ratio (AUC0-last) (Cycle 2/Cycle 1) was determined from plasma concentrations of irinotecan and metabolites (SN-38, SN-38G). Safety, efficacy, and drug-drug interactions were analyzed. Median observation period was 7.8 months; median number of cycles 15. Drug-drug interactions were evaluated in eight patients without irinotecan dose reduction. Mean AUC0-last ratios (with/without bevacizumab) of irinotecan, SN-38, and SN-38G were 0.959, 0.927, and 0.931 respectively. Response rate was 65%; median progression-free survival 16.4 months. Response occurred in four patients with, and nine without, UGT1A1 polymorphism. No significant differences occurred between efficacy, safety, or polymorphism status. This cohort showed no differences in safety or efficacy compared to previous reports. Bevacizumab did not affect the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and its metabolites, irrespective of UGT1A1 polymorphism status. '

S' NSABP B-40 was a 3 \xc3\x97 2 factorial trial testing whether adding capecitabine or gemcitabine to docetaxel followed by doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide neoadjuvant chemotherapy would improve outcomes in women with operable, HER2-negative breast cancer and whether adding neoadjuvant plus adjuvant bevacizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens would also improve outcomes. As reported previously, addition of neoadjuvant bevacizumab increased the proportion of patients achieving a pathological complete response, which was the primary endpoint. We present secondary patient outcomes, including disease-free survival, a specified endpoint by protocol, and data for distant recurrence-free interval, and overall survival, which were not prespecified endpoints but were collected prospectively.METHODS: In this randomised controlled trial (NSABP B-40), we enrolled women aged 18 years or older, with operable, HER2-non-amplified invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast, 2 cm or greater in diameter by palpation, clinical stage T1c-3, cN0, cN1, or cN2a, without metastatic disease and diagnosed by core needle biopsy. Patients received one of three docetaxel-based neoadjuvant regimens for four cycles: docetaxel alone (100 mg/m(2)) with addition of capecitabine (825 mg/m(2) oral twice daily days 1-14, 75 mg/m(2) docetaxel) or with addition of gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2) days 1 and 8 intravenously, 75 mg/m(2) docetaxel), all followed by neoadjuvant doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (60 mg/m(2) and 600 mg/m(2) intravenously) every 3 weeks for four cycles. Those randomly assigned to bevacizumab groups were to receive bevacizumab (15 mg/kg, every 3 weeks for six cycles) with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and postoperatively for ten doses. Randomisation was done (1:1:1:1:1:1) via a biased-coin minimisation procedure to balance the characteristics with respect to clinical nodal status, clinical tumour size, hormone receptor status, and age. Intent-to-treat analyses were done for disease-free survival and overall survival. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00408408" title="See in ClincalTrials.gov"NCT00408408</a.FINDINGS: "FINDINGS" Between Jan 5, 2007, and June 30, 2010, 1206 patients were enrolled in the study. Follow-up data were collected from Oct 31, 2007 to March 27, 2014, and were available for overall survival in 1186 patients, disease-free survival in 1184, and distant recurrence-free interval in 1181. Neither capecitabine nor gemcitabine increased disease-free survival or overall survival. Median follow-up was 4\xc2\xb77 years (IQR 4\xc2\xb70-5\xc2\xb72). The addition of bevacizumab significantly increased overall survival (hazard ratio 0\xc2\xb765 [95% CI 0\xc2\xb749-0\xc2\xb788]; p=0\xc2\xb7004) but did not significantly increase disease-free survival (0\xc2\xb780 [0\xc2\xb763-1\xc2\xb701]; p=0\xc2\xb706). Four deaths occurred on treatment due to vascular disorder (docetaxel plus capecitabine followed by doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide group), sudden death (docetaxel plus capecitabine followed by doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide group), infective endocarditis (docetaxel plus bevacizumab followed by doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide and bevacizumab group), and visceral arterial ischaemia (docetaxel followed by doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide group). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events in the bevacizumab group were neutropenia (grade 3, 99 [17%]; grade 4, 37 [6%]), hand-foot syndrome (grade 3, 63 [11%]), and hypertension (grade 3, 60 [10%]; grade 4, two [<1%]) and in the non-bevacizumab group were neutropenia (grade 3, 98 [16%]; grade 4, 36 [6%]), fatigue (grade 3, 53 [9%]), and hand-foot syndrome (grade 3, 43 [7%]).INTERPRETATION: "INTERPRETATION" The addition of gemcitabine or capecitabine to neoadjuvant docetaxel plus doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide does not seem to provide any benefit to patients with operable breast cancer, and should not change clinical practice in the short term. The improved overall survival with bevacizumab contradicts the findings of other studies of bevacizumab in breast cancer and may indicate the need for additional investigation of this agent.FUNDING: "FUNDING" National Institutes of Health, Genentech, Roche Laboratories, Lilly Research Laboratories, and Precision Therapeutics.'

We initiated a phase II trial to determine if the addition of bevacizumab to the standard R-CHOP regimen could enhance antitumor effects in patients with previously untreated MCL.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Eleven patients with previously untreated MCL received bevacizumab at 15 mg/kg on day 1, and standard CHOP-21 (CHOP given every 21 days per cycle) with rituximab (375 mg/m(2) per cycle) on day 3 of each cycle for a total of 6 cycles. Planned study end points included safety and efficacy assessment, and exploratory analysis of angiogenic profiles. The study was suspended in August of 2010 based on safety findings in DLBCL (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) of increased cardiovascular events with the regimen.RESULTS:  Beyond the standard R-CHOP safety profile, Grade 3 left ventricular dysfunction developed in 2 patients (18%), Grade 1/2 hypertension, proteinuria, and bleeding each developed in 1 patient (9%). The overall response rate was 82% with 36% complete response (CR)/complete response unconfirmed (CRu). The median progression-free survival (n = 11) was 18 months (95% confidence interval, 3-not reached), and 3-year overall survival rate was 82%. Correlative studies showed increased vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 expression in tumor cells at baseline, and elevated levels of plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) throughout treatment.: "" The addition of bevacizumab to the standard R-CHOP regimen did not appear to significantly improve efficacy beyond that observed from previous studies using R-CHOP alone. Therapeutic strategies that provide sustained inhibition on VEGF-related and VEGF-independent targets within the tumor microenvironment might further improve antiangiogenic effects and warrant further exploration in MCL.'

S' The aim of this study was to identify and validate novel predictive and/or prognostic serum proteomic biomarkers in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) treated as part of the phase III international ICON7 clinical trial.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN" ICON7 was a phase III international trial in EOC which showed a modest but statistically significant benefit in progression-free survival (PFS) with the addition of bevacizumab to standard chemotherapy. Serum samples from 10 patients who received bevacizumab (five responders and five nonresponders) were analyzed by mass spectrometry to identify candidate biomarkers. Initial validation and exploration by immunoassay was undertaken in an independent cohort of 92 patients, followed by a second independent cohort of 115 patients (taken from across both arms of the trial).RESULTS:  Three candidate biomarkers were identified: mesothelin, fms-like tyrosine kinase-4 (FLT4), and \xce\xb11-acid glycoprotein (AGP). Each showed evidence of independent prognostic potential when adjusting for high-risk status in initial (P < 0.02) and combined (P < 0.01) validation cohorts. In cohort I, individual biomarkers were not predictive of bevacizumab benefit; however, when combined with CA-125, a signature was developed that was predictive of bevacizumab response and discriminated benefit attributable to bevacizumab better than clinical characteristics. The signature showed weaker evidence of predictive ability in validation cohort II, but was still strongly predictive considering all samples (P = 0.001), with an improvement in median PFS of 5.5 months in signature-positive patients in the experimental arm compared with standard arm.S:  This study shows a discriminatory signature comprising mesothelin, FLT4, AGP, and CA-125 as potentially identifying those patients with EOC more likely to benefit from bevacizumab. These results require validation in further patient cohorts.'

S' Dysregulation of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/MET pathway is associated with poor prognosis, more aggressive biological characteristics of the tumor, and shortened survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Onartuzumab (MetMAb) is a recombinant humanized monovalent monoclonal antibody directed against MET. We present the treatment rationale and protocol for an ongoing randomized multicenter placebo-controlled phase II study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MetMAb combined with bevacizumab and mFOLFOX-6 (5-fluoruracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin).PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Eligible patients with previously untreated mCRC are randomized 1:1 to either mFOLFOX-6 combined with bevacizumab and placebo followed by 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin plus bevacizumab and placebo or mFOLFOX6, bevacizumab plus MetMAb followed by 5 FU/LV, bevacizumab, and MetMAb. The primary end point of this study is progression-free survival (PFS) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Secondary end points include overall survival (OS), objective response rate, and safety. Subanalyses will be performed to evaluate the effect of MET receptor expression on study primary and secondary end points. Correlative studies will be performed on tissue- and blood-derived biomarkers related to both HGF/MET signaling and other associated pathway markers.'

S' This phase 1 clinical trial was conducted to determine the safety, maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), and pharmacokinetics of imatinib, bevacizumab, and metronomic cyclophosphamide in patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC).METHODS:  Patients with refractory stage IV CRC were treated with bevacizumab 5\xe2\x80\x89mg\xe2\x80\x89kg(-1) i.v. every 2 weeks (fixed dose) plus oral cyclophosphamide q.d. and imatinib q.d. or b.i.d. in 28-day cycles with 3+3 dose escalation. Response was assessed every two cycles. Pharmacokinetics of imatinib and cyclophosphamide and circulating tumour, endothelial, and immune cell subsets were measured.RESULTS:  Thirty-five patients were enrolled. Maximum-tolerated doses were cyclophosphamide 50\xe2\x80\x89mg q.d., imatinib 400\xe2\x80\x89mg q.d., and bevacizumab 5\xe2\x80\x89mg\xe2\x80\x89kg(-1) i.v. every 2 weeks. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) included nausea/vomiting, neutropaenia, hyponatraemia, fistula, and haematuria. The DLT window required expansion to 42 days (1.5 cycles) to capture delayed toxicities. Imatinib exposure increased insignificantly after adding cyclophosphamide. Seven patients (20%) experienced stable disease for >6 months. Circulating tumour, endothelial, or immune cells were not associated with progression-free survival.: "" The combination of metronomic cyclophosphamide, imatinib, and bevacizumab is safe and tolerable without significant drug interactions. A subset of patients experienced prolonged stable disease independent of dose level.'

S' Melanomas are vascular tumors with a high incidence of BRAF mutations driving tumor proliferation. Complete inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling has potential for enhanced antitumor efficacy.METHODS:  Patients with advanced melanoma and adequate organ function were eligible. Sorafenib was given orally at 200 mg BiD for 5 days every week; bevacizumab was administered 5 mg/kg intravenously every 14 days. The primary objective was to determine clinical biological activity. The secondary objectives were safety, tolerability, and time to progression (TTP). Pharmacodynamic analysis included serum VEGF and soluble VEGF receptor-1 and VEGF receptor-2 performed at baseline, C1D15 and C2D1. The study was terminated during the first stage of a Simon two-stage design, after 14 of planned 21 subjects were enrolled.RESULTS:  Of the 14 patients who received treatment, no objective tumor responses were observed. Stable disease (SD) \xe2\x89\xa516 weeks was observed in 57 % patients, including three patients with SD lasting \xe2\x89\xa51 year. Median TTP was 32 weeks. The most frequently reported drug-related adverse events (AEs) were hand-foot syndrome (57.1 %), fatigue (57.1 %), hypertension (64.3 %), and proteinuria (35.7). Grade 3/4 drug-related AEs were hypertension (14.2 %), hand-foot syndrome, proteinuria, and thrombocytopenia (7 % each). Patients with low VEGF (<300 pg/ml) experienced longer TTP than those with high VEGF [median 50 vs. 15 weeks, p = 0.02). A similar pattern was seen for VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, although it did not reach statistical significance.S:  Combined VEGF/VEGFR blockade using bevacizumab with sorafenib shows clinical activity. The linkage between VEGF levels and time to tumor progression needs further exploration.'

S' Capecitabine is used mainly with oxaliplatin to treat metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Results from capecitabine plus irinotecan (XELIRI) with or without bevacizumab (BV) have been reported in Europe but not in Japan. Consequently, the safety and efficacy of XELIRI plus BV in Japanese patients with mCRC were assessed in a single-arm phase\xe2\x80\xafII study.METHODS:  Eligible patients had had prior chemotherapy containing BV for mCRC and wild-type or heterozygous UGT1A1. Therapy in each 21-day treatment cycle consisted of capecitabine (800\xe2\x80\xafmg/m(2) twice daily on days\xe2\x80\xaf1-15), irinotecan (200\xe2\x80\xafmg/m(2) on day\xe2\x80\xaf1), and BV (7.5\xe2\x80\xafmg/kg on day\xe2\x80\xaf1). The primary endpoint was dose-limiting toxicity in phase\xe2\x80\xafI and progression-free survival (PFS) in phase\xe2\x80\xafII.RESULTS:  A total of 34 patients (6 in phase\xe2\x80\xafI, 28 in phase\xe2\x80\xafII) were enrolled from May 2010 to June 2011. Baseline characteristics included a median age of 60 years (range: 22-74 years) for 24 men and 10 women. No dose-limiting toxicities appeared in phase\xe2\x80\xafI. Median PFS was 240 days (95% confidence interval: 179-311 days). Overall response rate was 18.1%, and the disease-control rate was 90.9%. The incidence of adverse events frequently associated with irinotecan and capecitabine were neutropenia (any grade, 55.9%; grade\xe2\x80\xaf3 or 4, 11.8%), diarrhea (any grade, 50%; grade\xe2\x80\xaf3 or 4, 5.9%), and hand-foot syndrome (any grade, 61.8%; grade\xe2\x80\xaf3 or 4, 5.9%).: "" Our results suggest that XELIRI plus BV is well tolerated and effective as a second-line treatment for mCRC in Japanese patients.

S' Continuous treatment with FOLFOX therapy is associated with peripheral nerve toxicity, and to improve this inconvenient side effect various methods of administration are being investigated. A regimen of intermittent oxaliplatin administration by continuous infusion therapy, i.e., modified FOLFOX7 (mFOLFOX7) + bevacizumab, was designed with the goal of alleviating severe peripheral nerve disorders and hematological toxicity. A phase II clinical study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this regimen.METHODS:  Previously untreated patients were assigned to mFOLFOX7 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2), levofolinate [l-LV] 200 mg/m(2), 5-fluorouracil [5-FU] 2400 mg/m(2)) + bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) administered every 2 weeks for 8 cycles, maintenance without oxaliplatin for 8 cycles, and reintroduction of mFOLFOX7 + bevacizumab for 8 cycles or until disease progression. Progression free survival (PFS) following the first dose (PFS 1) and following reintroduction of oxaliplatin (PFS 2) were used as indices for assessing the efficacy of intermittent administration.RESULTS:  Fifty-two patients were enrolled, with median age of 64 years (range, 36-74). Median PFS 1 was 11.8 months (95 % confidence interval [CI], 9.5 to 13.7), median time to treatment failure was 10.3 months (95 % CI, 5.6 to 12.1), percentage of patients with neutropenia of grade 3 or higher was 7.8 %, and percentage with peripheral nerve disorders was 3.9 %. Response rate was 50 %, and 84.4 % of patients who started modified simplified LV5FU2 + bevacizumab were reintroduced to oxaliplatin.: "" By excluding 5-FU bolus administration and administering bevacizumab continuously the mFOLFOX7 + bevacizumab regimen with preplanned withdrawal of oxaliplatin showed high tolerability and prevented severe peripheral neuropathy and neutropenia without reducing efficacy.'

S'PURPOSE The AVEREL trial [A Study of Avastin (Bevacizumab) in Combination With Herceptin (Trastuzumab)/Docetaxel in Patients With HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer] evaluated first-line bevacizumab-containing therapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -positive locally recurrent/metastatic breast cancer (LR/MBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with measurable/evaluable HER2-positive LR/MBC who had not received trastuzumab or chemotherapy for LR/MBC were stratified by prior adjuvant trastuzumab, prior (neo)adjuvant taxane, hormone receptor status, and measurable disease and were randomly assigned to receive docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) plus trastuzumab 8 mg/kg loading dose followed by 6 mg/kg either with bevacizumab 15 mg/kg or without bevacizumab, all administered every 3 weeks. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Additional end points included overall survival, response rate (RR), safety, quality of life, and translational research. Results Baseline characteristics of the 424 patients were balanced between treatment arms. Most patients had visceral metastases, 43% had a disease-free interval less than 12 months, and 85% had measurable disease. Median follow-up was 26 months. The hazard ratio for investigator-assessed PFS was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.65 to 1.02; P = .0775; median PFS, 13.7 v 16.5 months in the non-bevacizumab and bevacizumab arms, respectively; PFS events in 72%). The Independent Review Committee-assessed PFS hazard ratio was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.94; P = .0162; median PFS, 13.9 v 16.8 months, respectively; PFS events in 53%). The RR was 70% versus 74%, respectively (P = .3492). Grade \xe2\x89\xa5 3 febrile neutropenia and hypertension were more common with bevacizumab-containing therapy. High baseline plasma vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) concentrations were associated with greater bevacizumab benefit (not statistically significant).  Combining bevacizumab with docetaxel and trastuzumab did not significantly improve investigator-assessed PFS. The potential predictive value of plasma VEGF-A is consistent with findings in HER2-negative LR/MBC, warranting prospective evaluation.'

S' Both the epidermal growth factor receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor pathways are frequently overexpressed in glioblastoma multiforme. This study combined bevacizumab, a vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor, and erlotinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, with standard radiation and temozolomide (TMZ), with the goal of improving overall survival (OS).METHODS:  Treatment consisted of fractionated radiotherapy to 60 Gy, with daily TMZ at 75 mg/m\xc2\xb2/d and erlotinib 150-200 mg/d (or 500-600 mg/d for patients on enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs). Bevacizumab was given at 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, starting \xe2\x89\xa54 weeks after surgery. After radiotherapy, adjuvant TMZ was given at 200 mg/m\xc2\xb2/d \xc3\x97 5d per 28-day cycle, with unchanged erlotinib and bevacizumab doses. Treatment continued until progression or for 12 months. Efficacy was compared against an institutional historical control. A sample of 55 patients was calculated to provide 85% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.67 for OS.RESULTS:  Fifty-nine patients were enrolled for efficacy analysis after a 15-patient safety lead-in. For the efficacy group, median age was 54 years; median KPS was 90. Gross total and subtotal resections were achieved in 33% and 53%, respectively. The most frequent related grade 3/4 adverse effects were lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, diarrhea, weight loss, and fatigue. One patient died of disseminated aspergillosis. Median OS was 19.8 months (vs 18 mo for HC, P = .33) and median progression-free survival was 13.5 months (vs 8.6 mo for HC, P = .03).S:  The combination of bevacizumab, erlotinib, TMZ, and radiotherapy appears to be well tolerated and improved progression-free survival but did not reach the primary endpoint of improved OS.'

S'Adipose tissue is considered to have endocrine properties, including factors that are considered to have angiogenic activity. The current study aimed to evaluate whether there was a difference in the efficacy of bevacizumab for metastatic colon cancer patients according to their BMI (kg/m). A retrospective review of the medical records of consecutive patients who were treated with bevacizumab from diagnosis for metastatic colon cancer between 2005 and 2011 was carried out. Data extracted from medical files included demographics, height, weight, comorbidities, treatment protocols, time to tumor progression (TTP), and time of death. Variables were further evaluated with respect to TTP and overall survival (OS). The final analysis included 184 patients. The median TTP was 11.7 months and the median survival was 27.6 months. Chemotherapy dose reduction [P>0.001, hazard ratio (HR)=0.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.4-0.8] and male sex (P=0.03, HR=0.7, 95% CI 0.5-1.0) predicted shorter TTP. Multivariate analysis indicated that metastatic disease at initial presentation and/or diabetes were associated with worse OS: the median OS for diabetes was 20 versus 28.3 months for patients without diabetes (P=0.008, HR=2, 95% CI 1.2-3.4) and 23 months for patients with metastatic disease at initial presentation versus 31.4 months for recurrent disease (P=0.008, HR=1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.2). No differences were found for different BMIs subdivided into groups with respect to OS (P=0.84) or TTP (P=0.75). Our study did not show that bevacizumab is less effective in patients with a high BMI. It did show that diabetes and/or metastatic disease at initial diagnosis are associated with a poorer outcome. '

We conducted a phase II study of fulvestrant and bevacizumab in patients with aromatase inhibitor pretreated metastatic breast cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  A single-stage phase II study was conducted with these objectives: 6-month progression-free survival (PFS), tumor response, toxic effect, and overall survival. Regimen: 250 mg fulvestrant days 1 and 15 (cycle 1) then day 1 (cycle 2 and beyond) and 10 mg/kg bevacizumab days 1 and 15 of each 4-week cycle.RESULTS:  At interim analysis, 20 eligible patients initiated treatment, 11 were progression free and on treatment at 3 months, not meeting the protocol-specified efficacy requirements (at least 12 of 20). Accrual remained open during interim analysis with 36 patients enrolling before final study closure. Among the 33 eligible patients, the median PFS was 6.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.6-10.1 months]. Of the 18 with measurable disease, 4 (22%) patients (95% CI 6% to 48%) had a confirmed tumor response (1 complete, 3 partial).

Formalin-fixed tumors were macrodissected for reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction relative quantification of VEGF-A165, -189, and -206 isoforms spliced at exon 8 proximal splice site (VEGF-Axxxa) and at exon 8 distal splice site (VEGF-Axxxb).RESULTS:  For high VEGF-Axxxa, the hazard ratios (HRs) for progression were 1.08 (P = .71) in non-bevacizumab-treated patients (cohort A) and 0.66 (P = .22) in bevacizumab-treated patients (cohort B), and the HRs for death were 1.45 (P = .13) and 0.50 (P = .049), respectively. The interaction of VEGF-Axxxa with bevacizumab administration was significant (P = .011) for overall survival (OS). High tissue VEGF-Axxxb was not prognostic in cohort A but was predictive for bevacizumab benefit in cohort B (HR for progression, 0.57 [P = .04]; HR for death, 0.51 [P = .02]). Exploratory analyses done only in cohort B suggested that abundance of VEGFR1 messenger RNA (mRNA) in peripheral blood and low VEGFR2 mRNA in tissue correlated with poor outcome. In multivariate analysis, high tissue mRNA of angiogenic VEGF-Axxxa in the presence of bevacizumab therapy predicted for favorable progression-free survival (HR for progression, 0.39; P = .0227) and OS (HR for death, 0.32; P = .0140).: "" Tissue mRNA expression of angiogenic VEGF-Axxxa isoforms was retrospectively associated with adverse prognosis in the absence of bevacizumab and with favorable outcome when bevacizumab was administered in patients with advanced breast cancer.'

S' The addition of bevacizumab to paclitaxel or capecitabine has demonstrated improved progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) as compared with chemotherapy alone in patients with HER2-negative locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer (LR/MBC). We evaluated the efficacy and safety of first-line therapy of paclitaxel and bevacizumab with or without capecitabine in patients with HER2-negative LR/MBC.METHODS:  In this multicentre, open-label, randomised phase II trial, women with HER2-negative LR/MBC were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to paclitaxel (90 mg/m2 intravenously [IV] on days 1, 8, and 15) and bevacizumab (10 mg/kg IV on days 1 and 15) every 4 weeks for six cycles, followed by bevacizumab (15 mg/kg IV on day 1) every 3 weeks (AT) or to paclitaxel (90 mg/m2 IV on days 1 and 8), bevacizumab (15 mg/kg IV on day 1) and capecitabine (825 mg/m2 orally twice daily on days 1\xe2\x80\x9314) every 3 weeks for eight cycles, followed by bevacizumab and capecitabine at the same doses every 3 weeks (ATX). The primary end-point was investigator-assessed PFS. Secondary end-points included ORR, duration of response, overall survival (OS) and safety. Exploratory analyses were conducted to evaluate the impact of capecitabine on OS and to validate a novel prognostic model. This trial is registered with EudraCT, number 2006-006058-83.FINDINGS: "FINDINGS" Median PFS was significantly longer in ATX as compared with AT (11.2 months versus 8.4 months; stratified hazard ratio (HR), 0.52; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.41\xe2\x80\x930.67; p < 0.0001). The ORR in ATX patients with measurable disease (n = 268) was higher than that in AT (69% versus 51%; p = 0.01). The median duration of response was 6.8 versus 5.4 months for, respectively, ATX and AT (p < 0.0001). Median OS was 24.2 months for ATX and 23.1 months for AT (p = 0.53). The increased rate of grade 3\xe2\x80\x934 adverse events related to the addition of capecitabine, being hand-foot syndrome (34% versus 0% for AT) and neutropenia (20% versus 12% for AT), generally did not preclude continuation of treatment. Exploratory analyses indicated that (1) patients receiving capecitabine at some line for treatment have significantly improved OS and (2) a prognostic model can classify patients into three risk groups associated with OS.INTERPRETATION: "INTERPRETATION" In patients with HER2-negative LR/MBC, addition of capecitabine to paclitaxel and bevacizumab significantly improved PFS, ORR and response duration. This combination was reasonably well tolerated and may be considered of use as first-line treatment in rapidly progressive disease.FUNDING: "FUNDING" F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, the Netherlands.'

All patients experienced grade 3 toxicity, but no dose-limiting toxicities or significant bleeding episodes were observed. Significant reductions were noted in tumor proliferation (FLT-PET), tumor hypoxia (Cu-ATSM-PET), and DCE-CT contrast enhancement after bevacizumab monotherapy, with further decreases in FLT-PET and Cu-ATSM-PET during the combined therapy course.S:  The incorporation of bevacizumab into comprehensive chemoradiation therapy regimens for patients with HNSCC appears safe and feasible. Experimental imaging demonstrates measureable changes in tumor proliferation, hypoxia, and perfusion after bevacizumab monotherapy and during chemoradiation therapy. These findings suggest opportunities to preview the clinical outcomes for individual patients and thereby design personalized therapy approaches in future trials.'

S' GOG 240 was a practice-changing randomised phase 3 trial that concluded that chemotherapy plus bevacizumab for advanced cervical cancer significantly improves overall and progression-free survival, and the proportion of patients achieving an overall objective response, compared with chemotherapy alone. In this study, we aimed to analyse patient-reported outcomes in GOG 240.METHODS: Eligible adult participants (aged \xe2\x89\xa518 years) had primary stage IVB or recurrent or persistent carcinoma of the cervix with measurable disease and GOG performance status of 0-1. Participants were randomly assigned by web-based permuted block randomisation (block size 4) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to the four treatment groups: cisplatin (50 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 1 or 2 of the treatment cycle) and paclitaxel (135 mg/m(2) intravenously over 24 h or 175 mg/m(2) intravenously over 3 h on day 1), with or without bevacizumab (15 mg/kg intravenously on day 1 or 2), or paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2) over 3 h on day 1) and topotecan (0\xc2\xb775 mg/m(2) for 30 min on days 1-3) with or without bevacizumab (15 mg/kg intravenously on day 1). Treatment assignment was concealed at randomisation (everyone was masked to treatment assignment, achieved by the use of a computer encrypted numbering system at the National Cancer Institute) and became open-label when each patient was registered to the trial. Treatment cycles were repeated every 21 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurred first. The coprimary endpoints of the trial were overall survival and safety; the primary quality-of-life endpoint was the score on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cervix Trial Outcome Index (FACT-Cx TOI). For our analysis of patient-reported outcomes, participants were assessed before treatment cycles 1, 2, and 5, and at 6 and 9 months after the start of cycle 1, with the FACT-Cx TOI, items from the FACT-GOG-Neurotoxicity subscale, and a worst pain item from the Brief Pain Inventory. All patients who completed baseline quality-of-life assessments and at least one further follow-up assessment were evaluable for quality-of-life outcomes. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00803062" title="See in ClincalTrials.gov"NCT00803062</a.FINDINGS: "FINDINGS" Between April 6, 2009, and Jan 3, 2012, a total of 452 patients were enrolled in the trial, of whom 390 completed baseline quality-of-life assessment and at least one further assessment and were therefore evaluable for quality-of-life outcomes. In these patients, patient-reported outcome completion declined from 426 (94%) of 452 (at baseline) to 193 (63%) of 307 (9 months post-cycle 1), but completion rates did not differ significantly between treatment regimens (p=0\xc2\xb778). The baseline FACT-Cx TOI scores did not differ significantly between patients who received bevacizumab versus those who did not (p=0\xc2\xb727). Compared with patients who received chemotherapy alone, patients who received chemotherapy plus bevacizumab reported FACT-Cx TOI scores that were an average of 1\xc2\xb72 points lower (98\xc2\xb775% CI -4\xc2\xb71 to 1\xc2\xb77; p=0\xc2\xb730).INTERPRETATION: "INTERPRETATION" Improvements in overall survival and progression-free survival attributed to the incorporation of bevacizumab into the treatment of advanced cervical cancer were not accompanied by any significant deterioration in health-related quality of life. Patients responding to anti-angiogenesis therapy who maintain an acceptable quality of life could be suitable at progression for treatment with other novel therapies that might confer additional benefit.FUNDING: "FUNDING" National Institutes of Health.'

S'"" To assess efficacy of membrane peeling combined with intravitreal injection of bevacizumab in the treatment of macular epiretinal membrane.METHODS:  From January, 2012 to June, 2013, 33 patients (33 eyes) with the diagnosis of macular epiretinal membrane underwent vitreous surgery and membrane peeling. The patients were randomly divided into intravitreal bevacizumab group (IVB group) and non-intravitreal bevacizumab group (non-IVB group). All the patients underwent standard three-port vitrectomy and peeling of epiretinal membrane, with intravitreal injection of 1.5 mg bevacizumab at the end of operation in IVB group. The best corrected visual acuity and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were examined before and after the treatment. The patients were followed up for 3-14 months (mean 6.5 months).RESULTS:  Macular epiretinal membranes were successfully peeled during operation in all the patients without postoperative intraocular infection or bleeding. Fifteen eyes received vitrectomy combined with intravitreal injection of bevacizumab, and 18 underwent only vitreous operation and membrane peeling. At the end of the follow up, the visual acuity improved in 11 eyes (73.3%) in IVB group, as compared to 13 eyes (72.2%) in the non-IVB group (P=0.627). Central macular thickness decreased by 143\xe2\x88\x9362 \xc2\xb5m in IVB group and by 96\xe2\x88\x9328 \xc2\xb5m in non-IVB group, showing a significant difference between the two groups (t=5.564, P<0.01).: "" Vitrectomy and membrane peeling combined with intravitreal injection of bevacizumab can promote the recovery of macular morphology but not visual function, and its clinical use still needs to be tested in a long-term and large-sample randomized controlled study.'

S'"AIMS" This phase I dose-escalation study was designed to evaluate the combination of the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor ridaforolimus with the vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor bevacizumab.: "" Seventeen adult patients with refractory advanced solid tumours received oral ridaforolimus (30 or 40 mg) once daily for 5 days per week (QDx5/wk) combined with intravenous bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks [Q2wk] or 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks [Q3wk]). Patients were evaluated for dose-limiting toxicities, safety and anti-tumour activity.RESULTS:  A 40 mg dose of ridaforolimus with either bevacizumab dosing schedule was the recommended phase II dose. No dose-limiting toxicities were reported; the most common drug-related adverse events were mucosal inflammation and anorexia. Seven patients, with clinical features that included primary tumour of the abdominal origin (colorectal, pancreatic or gynaecological cancers) and previous abdominal radiotherapy, reported serious adverse events related to bowel perforations. There were no objective responses, but 65% of patients had a best response of stable disease.: "" Oral ridaforolimus (40 mg QDx5/wk) is feasible to combine with standard doses of bevacizumab, although careful patient selection would be needed to mitigate the risk of bowel perforation-related adverse events.

As a result of the promising nature of phase II studies, a randomized phase III trial was designed to assess the efficacy of adding bevacizumab to first-line chemotherapy with cisplatin-etoposide for treatment of extensive disease SCLC. We present the treatment rationale and study design of GOIRC trial (FARM6PMFJM study), a multicenter randomized phase III study, supported by AIFA (Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco).PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Patients are randomized to receive either cisplatin 25 mg/m(2) and etoposide 100 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1 to 3 (control arm) or the same chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg intravenously on day 1 (experimental arm). Treatment is repeated every 3 weeks and for a maximum of 6 courses. Patients randomized to the experimental arm in the absence of disease progression after 6 cycles continue bevacizumab alone until progression or for a maximum of 18 courses. Tumor assessment is done every 3 cycles. Major eligibility criteria are: age \xe2\x89\xa5 18 years; histologically or cytologically documented extensive disease SCLC; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status \xe2\x89\xa4 2; adequate hematological, hepatic and renal functions; no history of grade 2 or higher hemoptysis; and no evidence of tumor cavitation.

S' Molecularly targeted agents for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can provide similar efficacy to chemotherapy without chemotherapy-associated toxicities. Combining two agents with different modes of action could further increase the efficacy of these therapies. The TASK study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib in combination with the anti-angiogenic agent bevacizumab as first-line therapy in unselected, advanced non-squamous NSCLC patients.METHODS:  Patients were recruited from December 2007 to September 2008. Planned sample size was 200 patients, a total of 124 patients were randomized. Patients were randomized using a minimization algorithm 1:1 to receive bevacizumab (iv 15 mg/kg day 1 of each 21-day cycle) plus chemotherapy (gemcitabine/cisplatin or carboplatin/paclitaxel standard doses, 4-6 cycles) (BC arm) or bevacizumab plus erlotinib (p.o. 150 mg/day; BE arm) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). If the hazard ratio (HR) of PFS for BE relative to BC was above 1.25 at the pre-planned interim analysis in favor of BC, the study would be re-evaluated. Secondary endpoints included overall survival, response rate and safety.RESULTS:  All randomized patients (n = 63 BE; n = 61 BC) were evaluated for the efficacy analyses. At the updated interim analysis, median PFS was 18.4 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI] 17.0-25.1) versus 25.0 weeks (95% CI 20.6-[not reached]) for BE versus BC, respectively (HR for death or disease progression, BE relative to BC, 2.05, p = 0.0183). The incidence of death was 19% for BE treatment compared with 11.5% for BC treatment. The HR for PFS at the updated interim analysis was above 1.25, therefore patients on the BE arm were permitted to change arms or switch to another drug and the study was terminated. Adverse events reported were as expected.S:  The TASK study did not show a benefit in terms of PFS for the combination of erlotinib with bevacizumab in unselected first-line advanced non-squamous NSCLC compared with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab.'

We assessed the efficacy and safety of further bevacizumab therapy in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer whose disease had progressed after treatment with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy.METHODS: In this open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients who had HER2-negative locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer that had progressed after receiving 12 weeks or more of first-line bevacizumab plus chemotherapy from 118 centres in 12 countries. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by use of a central interactive voice response system using a block randomisation schedule (block size four) stratified by hormone receptor status, first-line progression-free survival, selected chemotherapy, and lactate dehydrogenase concentration, to receive second-line single-agent chemotherapy either alone or with bevacizumab (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks). Second-line therapy was continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal. At progression, patients randomly assigned to chemotherapy alone received third-line chemotherapy without bevacizumab; those randomly assigned to bevacizumab continued bevacizumab with third-line chemotherapy.

S'Categorizations of best response observed at week 8 (between week 3 and 14) of first-line treatment in two studies of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy in Western (878 patients) and Chinese (198 patients) patients with non-small cell lung cancer were assessed together with baseline prognostic factors in multivariate parametric models to predict overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS). Predictive performances of the models were assessed by simulating multiple replicates of the studies. Disease control rate (DCR) was the best response categorization to predict OS and PFS. In the OS model, DCR fully captured bevacizumab effect. For PFS, DCR did not fully capture bevacizumab treatment effect. The models adequately predicted OS and PFS distributions in each arm as well as bevacizumab hazard ratio (HR) for OS and PFS, for example, in Western patients (model prediction [95% prediction interval]: 0.84 [0.71-0.98] vs. observed: 0.77 for OS and 0.59 [0.49-0.72] vs. observed: 0.58 for PFS). Covariates in the models captured endpoint differences seen in Chinese patients. There was no impact of Chinese ethnicity on the DCR relationship to OS or PFS. DCR predicted OS benefit with bevacizumab in first-line NSCLC patients. Western data can be used to inform design of studies in Chinese patients. '

Between the control group and the BRVO group, no significant differences were noted between pre- and postinjection best-corrected visual acuity (p=0.60, p=0.54) and central foveal thickness (p=0.47, p=0.82). In the triamcinolone group, levels of IL-6, IL-17, IP-10, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AA and VEGF were reduced significantly (p=0.012, p<0.001, p<0.001, p=0.015, and p<0.001, respectively). But in bevacizumab group, only VEGF was significantly reduced (p<0.001). Between the IVTA group and the IVBe group, no significant differences in the changes in VEGF levels were noted (p=0.06).: "" Triamcinolone injection reduces plural inflammatory cytokines in BRVO, while bevacizumab has no influence on other cytokines as selective anti-VEGF therapy. No differences in the therapeutic effect were noted between an inhibition of plural inflammatory cytokines and an inhibition of VEGF only.'

S'"S" Optimal treatment strategies in frail and/or elderly patients with metastatic colorectal cancer have not been well defined. Using data from a prospective, phase II study of elderly patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with bevacizumab and capecitabine, we explored the differences in functional measure and quality of life (QoL) between patients with ECOG performance status (PS) 1 and 2.: "" Geriatric functional measures included patient reported limitations in ADLs and IADLs, ECOG PS, 3-item recall, hearing acuity, and the "Get up and Go" test. QoL was assessed by means of the FACT-C questionnaire and the EQ-5D questionnaire. The prognostic impact of baseline characteristics on survival was studied using univariate Cox regression analysis.RESULTS:  The majority (62%) of the 45 patients had an ECOG PS of 2. The ECOG PS 2 group had more limitations in IADLs, lower baseline QoL, and a lower patient-rated health score. For all participants, QoL significantly improved from baseline to the start of cycle 2 (FACT-C: 99.9 vs. 105.4, p=0.01) and did not deteriorate when baseline scores were compared to when participants went off study (FACT-C: 99.9 vs. 98.6, p=0.59). In the Cox-regression analysis, a positive "Get up and Go" test was prognostic for improved survival (HR=0.31, p=0.01).: "" There is significant heterogeneity in functional measures and quality of life among elderly patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with ECOG PS 1 and 2.

S'"INTRODUCTION" Treatment impact on quality of life (QoL) informs treatment management decisions in advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NS NSCLC). QoL outcomes from the phase III PointBreak trial are reported.METHODS:  Chemonaive patients (n = 939) with stage IIIB/IV nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 1 were randomized (1:1) to pemetrexed-carboplatin-bevacizumab (pemetrexed arm) or paclitaxel-carboplatin-bevacizumab (paclitaxel arm). Patients without progressive disease received maintenance pemetrexed-bevacizumab (pemetrexed arm) or bevacizumab (paclitaxel arm). QoL was assessed using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-General (FACT-G), FACT-Lung (FACT-L), and FACT/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity (FACT-Ntx) instruments. Subscale scores, total scores, and trial outcome indices were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models. Post hoc analyses examined the association between baseline FACT scores and overall survival (OS).RESULTS:  Mean score differences in change from baseline significantly favored the pemetrexed arm for the neurotoxicity subscale score, FACT-Ntx total scores, and FACT-Ntx trial outcome index. They occurred at cycle 2 (p < 0.001) and persisted through induction cycles 2 to 4 and six maintenance cycles. Investigator-assessed, qualitative, drug-related differences in grade 2 (1.6% versus 10.6%) and grade 3 (0.0% versus 4.1%) sensory neuropathy and grade 3/4 fatigue (10.9% versus 5.0%, p = 0.0012) were observed between the pemetrexed and paclitaxel arms. Baseline FACT-G, FACT-L, and FACT-Ntx scores were significant prognostic factors for OS (p < 0.001).S:  Randomized patients reported similar changes in QoL, except for less change from baseline in neurotoxicity on the pemetrexed arm; investigators reported greater neurotoxicity on the paclitaxel arm and greater fatigue on the pemetrexed arm. Higher baseline FACT scores were favorable prognostic factors for OS.'

S' Bevacizumab plus chemotherapy is a widely used therapeutic option for first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, molecular predictors of bevacizumab efficacy have not yet been identified. We analyzed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) polymorphisms in relation to response to bevacizumab.METHODS:  Two hundred and thirty-seven patients with mCRC enrolled onto the phase III prospective multicentre randomized "Italian Trial in Advanced Colorectal Cancer (ITACa)" trial were evaluated. One hundred fourteen patients received chemotherapy plus bevacizumab (CT + B) and 123 received chemotherapy (CT) alone. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (-2578, -1498, -1154, -634 and +936) for VEGF and 2 SNPs (-786, +894) and one variable number tandem repeat in intron 4 for eNOS were analyzed for each patient. The polymorphisms were assessed in relation to progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS).RESULTS:  VEGF 936C/T, eNOS +894 G/T and VNTR were significantly correlated with outcome in CT + B patients, but not in CT-only patients. In particular, patients with a specific haplotype combination of the 2 eNOS polymorphisms (defined eNOS Haplo1/Haplo1 and eNOS Haplo 2/Haplo2) showed significantly longer PFS (15.0 vs 9.1 months, P = 0.001) and OS (34.5 vs 20.5 months P = 0.002), and a higher ORR (71 vs 45.9%, P = 0.013) than those with the other genotypes, respectively.S:  Specific eNOS polymorphisms may be capable of identifying a subset of mCRC patients who are more responsive to bevacizumab-based chemotherapy. If confirmed, these results would permit individually tailored treatment with bevacizumab.'

Docetaxel has been studied with bevacizumab at the maximally tolerated dose of 100 mg/m(2). We investigated the effects of combining bevacizumab with docetaxel (75 mg/m(2)) with or without trastuzumab for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2(+)) and HER2-negative (HER2(-)) patients, respectively.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  We conducted a phase II study, stratified by HER2 status, of patients with locally advanced breast cancer or MBC who had received no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease and showed no evidence or history of central nervous system metastases. Stratum 1 (HER2(-)) treatment consisted of bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) followed by docetaxel (75 mg/m(2)) administered every 3 weeks; stratum 2 (HER2(+)) treatment was the same as that of stratum 1 with the addition of trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose on day 2 of cycle 1, and 6\xc2\xa0mg/kg on day 1 of all subsequent cycles).RESULTS:  The trial accrued 73 patients (stratum 1, 52 patients; stratum 2, 21 patients). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse event (all strata) was fatigue (stratum 1, 11.5%; stratum 2, 10%). The incidence of grade 3 hypertension was 6% for stratum 1 and 5% for stratum 2. The median PFS was 8.4 months (95% CI, 5.2-10.4 months) in stratum 1; the median PFS in stratum 2 was 13.3 months (95% CI, 11.9-35.4 months). The overall response rate for stratum 1was 58% and for stratum 2 was 81%, and the clinical benefit rates were 67% and 81%, respectively.: "" In first-line treatment of MBC, adding docetaxel (75 mg/m(2)) to bevacizumab administered every 3 weeks in HER2(-) patients, and docetaxel plus trastuzumab plus bevacizumab treatment in HER2(+) patients are feasible and safe, with high response rates and promising PFS compared with those of bevacizumab-naive historic controls.'

The outcome measures previously used in clinical trials of intravitreal ranibizumab in DMO were employed to describe the visual acuity and macular thickness changes at 12 and 24 months.RESULTS:  The standard outcomes of mean change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central macular thickness (CMT) in participants treated with bevacizumab were comparable to those reported in association with ranibizumab. However, exploratory analyses showed that thick maculae at baseline defined as CMT of \xe2\x89\xa5 400 \xc2\xb5m, remained significantly thicker than those <400 \xc2\xb5m with intensive bevacizumab therapy, despite a comparable gain in visual acuity at both 12 and 24 months.

Results were analyzed using linear regression with generalized estimation equation methods to account for between-eye correlation.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES" The primary outcome was the proportion of eyes that improved vision by 10 logarithm of minimum angle of resolution letters. Secondary outcomes included mean change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), change in central macular thickness (CMT), injection frequency, and adverse events. Patient-reported outcomes were measured using the Impact of Vision Impairment (IVI) questionnaire.RESULTS:  Improvement in BCVA of 10 or more letters was found in 17 of 42 eyes (40%) treated with bevacizumab compared with 19 of 46 dexamethasone implant-treated eyes (41%; P = 0.83). None of the 42 bevacizumab eyes lost 10 letters or more, whereas 5 of 46 (11%) dexamethasone implant eyes did, mostly because of cataract. Mean CMT decreased by 122 \xce\xbcm for bevacizumab eyes and by 187 \xce\xbcm for dexamethasone implant eyes (P = 0.015). Bevacizumab-treated eyes received a mean of 8.6 injections compared with 2.7 injections for dexamethasone implant eyes. Significant improvement in IVI scores occurred for both treatment groups.S:  Dexamethasone implant achieved similar rates of visual acuity improvement compared with bevacizumab for DME, with superior anatomic outcomes and fewer injections. Both treatments were associated with improvement in visual quality-of-life scores. However, more dexamethasone implant-treated eyes lost vision, mainly because of cataract.'

S' Reports have demonstrated the superior activity of combining both irinotecan and oxaliplatin (FOLFOXIRI) therapy. An option for gaining similar benefits with less toxicity would be the administration of irinotecan through a hepatic artery approach. The aim of this study was to assess the response and adverse event rates for irinotecan drug-eluting beads (DEBIRI) with folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) and bevacizumab as a first-line treatment for unresectable colorectal liver metastasis.METHODS:  Patients with colorectal liver metastases were randomly assigned to modified FOLFOX (mFOLFOX) and bevacizumab or mFOLFOX6, bevacizumab, and DEBIRI (FOLFOX-DEBIRI). The primary endpoint was the response rate. The secondary endpoints were adverse events, the rate of conversion to resection, and progression-free survival.RESULTS:  The intention-to-treat population comprised 70 patients: 10 patients in the pilot and then 30 patients randomly assigned to the FOLFOX-DEBIRI arm and 30 patients randomly assigned to the FOLFOX/bevacizumab arm. The 2 groups were similar with respect to the extent of liver involvement (30% vs 30%), but a greater percentage of patients in the FOLFOX-DEBIRI arm had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or 2 (57% vs 31%) and extrahepatic disease (56% vs 32%, P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89.02). The median numbers of chemotherapy cycles were similar (10 vs 9), and there were similar rates of grade 3/4 adverse events (54% for the FOLFOX-DEBIRI group vs 46% for the FOLFOX/bevacizumab group). The overall response rate was significantly greater in the FOLFOX-DEBIRI arm versus the FOLFOX/bevacizumab arm at 2 (78% vs 54%, P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89.02), 4 (95% vs 70%, P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89.03), and 6 months (76% vs 60%, P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89.05). There was significantly more downsizing to resection in the FOLFOX-DEBIRI arm versus the FOLFOX/bevacizumab arm (35% vs 16%, P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89.05), and there was improved median progression-free survival (15.3 vs 7.6 months).S:  The simultaneous administration of mFOLFOX6 (with or without bevacizumab) and DEBIRI through the hepatic artery (FOLFOX-DEBIRI) is safe and does not cause treatment delays or increase the systemic toxicity of chemotherapy. This strategy leads to improved overall response rates, improved hepatic progression-free survival, and more durable overall progression-free survival in patients downsized to resection.'

S'"BACKGROUND AND " This study examines the clinical response of patients transitioned to aflibercept, the newest anti-VEGF medication, due to persistent evidence of exudation on optical coherence tomography (OCT) despite regular treatment with bevacizumab and/or ranibizumab.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Aflibercept was administered to 111 patients considered for study inclusion. Eyes were included if they were transitioned to aflibercept for treatment of persistent exudation on OCT despite regular treatment with at least three injections of ranibizumab or bevacizumab. Retrospective data were collected from medical records.RESULTS:  Complete resolution of exudation was seen in 34% of eyes at final follow-up. Clear improvement in exudation amount or severity without complete resolution was seen in 25%. No improvement was seen in 34%, and 6% demonstrated worsening of exudation. Snellen visual acuity at the time of transition versus final follow-up after aflibercept injection did not appreciably change (logMAR 0.494 to 0.505, Snellen equivalent 20/62 to 20/64; P = .84).

S' One third of patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) achieve pathologic complete response (pCR) with standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). CALGB 40603 (Alliance), a 2 \xc3\x97 2 factorial, open-label, randomized phase II trial, evaluated the impact of adding carboplatin and/or bevacizumab.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Patients (N = 443) with stage II to III TNBC received paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) once per week (wP) for 12 weeks, followed by doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide once every 2 weeks (ddAC) for four cycles, and were randomly assigned to concurrent carboplatin (area under curve 6) once every 3 weeks for four cycles and/or bevacizumab 10 mg/kg once every 2 weeks for nine cycles. Effects of adding these agents on pCR breast (ypT0/is), pCR breast/axilla (ypT0/isN0), treatment delivery, and toxicities were analyzed.RESULTS:  Patients assigned to either carboplatin or bevacizumab were less likely to complete wP and ddAC without skipped doses, dose modification, or early discontinuation resulting from toxicity. Grade \xe2\x89\xa5 3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were more common with carboplatin, as were hypertension, infection, thromboembolic events, bleeding, and postoperative complications with bevacizumab. Employing one-sided P values, addition of either carboplatin (60% v 44%; P = .0018) or bevacizumab (59% v 48%; P = .0089) significantly increased pCR breast, whereas only carboplatin (54% v 41%; P = .0029) significantly raised pCR breast/axilla. More-than-additive interactions between the two agents could not be demonstrated.: "" In stage II to III TNBC, addition of either carboplatin or bevacizumab to NACT increased pCR rates, but whether this will improve relapse-free or overall survival is unknown. Given results from recently reported adjuvant trials, further investigation of bevacizumab in this setting is unlikely, but the role of carboplatin could be evaluated in definitive studies, ideally limited to biologically defined patient subsets most likely to benefit from this agent.'

S' The optimum duration of first-line treatment with chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer is unknown. The CAIRO3 study was designed to determine the efficacy of maintenance treatment with capecitabine plus bevacizumab versus observation.METHODS: In this open-label, phase 3, randomised controlled trial, we recruited patients in 64 hospitals in the Netherlands. We included patients older than 18 years with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer, with stable disease or better after induction treatment with six 3-weekly cycles of capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab (CAPOX-B), WHO performance status of 0 or 1, and adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either maintenance treatment with capecitabine and bevacizumab (maintenance group) or observation (observation group). Randomisation was done centrally by minimisation, with stratification according to previous adjuvant chemotherapy, response to induction treatment, WHO performance status, serum lactate dehydrogenase concentration, and treatment centre. Both patients and investigators were aware of treatment assignment. We assessed disease status every 9 weeks. On first progression (defined as PFS1), patients in both groups were to receive the induction regimen of CAPOX-B until second progression (PFS2), which was the study\'s primary endpoint. All endpoints were calculated from the time of randomisation. Analyses were done by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00442637" title="See in ClincalTrials.gov"NCT00442637</a.FINDINGS: "FINDINGS" Between May 30, 2007, and Oct 15, 2012, we randomly assigned 558 patients to either the maintenance group (n=279) or the observation group (n=279). Median follow-up was 48 months (IQR 36-57). The primary endpoint of median PFS2 was significantly improved in patients on maintenance treatment, and was 8\xc2\xb75 months in the observation group and 11\xc2\xb77 months in the maintenance group (HR 0\xc2\xb767, 95% CI 0\xc2\xb756-0\xc2\xb781, p<0\xc2\xb70001). This difference remained significant when any treatment after PFS1 was considered. Maintenance treatment was well tolerated, although the incidence of hand-foot syndrome was increased (64 [23%] patients with hand-foot skin reaction during maintenance). The global quality of life did not deteriorate during maintenance treatment and was clinically not different between treatment groups.INTERPRETATION: "INTERPRETATION" Maintenance treatment with capecitabine plus bevacizumab after six cycles of CAPOX-B in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer is effective and does not compromise quality of life.FUNDING: "FUNDING" Dutch Colorectal Cancer Group (DCCG).

S' Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promotes angiogenesis, a mediator of disease progression in cervical cancer. Bevacizumab, a humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, has single-agent activity in previously treated, recurrent disease. Most patients in whom recurrent cervical cancer develops have previously received cisplatin with radiation therapy, which reduces the effectiveness of cisplatin at the time of recurrence. We evaluated the effectiveness of bevacizumab and nonplatinum combination chemotherapy in patients with recurrent, persistent, or metastatic cervical cancer.METHODS:  Using a 2-by-2 factorial design, we randomly assigned 452 patients to chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab at a dose of 15 mg per kilogram of body weight. Chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin at a dose of 50 mg per square meter of body-surface area, plus paclitaxel at a dose of 135 or 175 mg per square meter or topotecan at a dose of 0.75 mg per square meter on days 1 to 3, plus paclitaxel at a dose of 175 mg per square meter on day 1. Cycles were repeated every 21 days until disease progression, the development of unacceptable toxic effects, or a complete response was documented. The primary end point was overall survival; a reduction of 30% in the hazard ratio for death was considered clinically important.RESULTS:  Groups were well balanced with respect to age, histologic findings, performance status, previous use or nonuse of a radiosensitizing platinum agent, and disease status. Topotecan-paclitaxel was not superior to cisplatin-paclitaxel (hazard ratio for death, 1.20). With the data for the two chemotherapy regimens combined, the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy was associated with increased overall survival (17.0 months vs. 13.3 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.71; 98% confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.95; P=0.004 in a one-sided test) and higher response rates (48% vs. 36%, P=0.008). Bevacizumab, as compared with chemotherapy alone, was associated with an increased incidence of hypertension of grade 2 or higher (25% vs. 2%), thromboembolic events of grade 3 or higher (8% vs. 1%), and gastrointestinal fistulas of grade 3 or higher (3% vs. 0%).'

S' Bevacizumab is associated with an increased risk of arterial thromboembolism (ATE); however, its effect on venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains controversial. Scant data exist on the factors that increase the risk of ATE/VTE in patients with prostate cancer. The authors investigated the association of bevacizumab treatment and clinical factors with ATE/VTE risk in patients who were treated on Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) trial 90401.METHODS:  Patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer were randomized to receive docetaxel and prednisone with or without bevacizumab once every 21 days. Cycle-to-event Cox regression models were used to investigate the association of bevacizumab with the incidence of grade 3 or greater (\xe2\x89\xa5 3) ATE and VTE. Age, prior ATE/VTE, baseline antiplatelet/anticoagulant use, and VTE risk score (based on leukocyte count, hemoglobin, platelet count, body mass index, and tumor location) were evaluated in univariate and multivariable analyses.RESULTS:  Of 1008 randomized patients, the odds of experiencing grade \xe2\x89\xa5 3 ATE were significantly greater in those who received bevacizumab compared with those who received placebo (odds ratio, 2.79; P = .02), whereas an opposite trend was noted for grade \xe2\x89\xa5 3 VTE (odds ratio, 0.60; P = .08). In the multivariable analysis, bevacizumab treatment (hazard ratio [HR], 3.00; P = .01) and age (HR, 1.06; P = .02) were significantly associated with the risk of ATE; whereas age (HR, 1.05; P = .01) and VTE risk score (HR, 1.83; P = .03) were significantly associated with the risk of VTE.S:  Bevacizumab was significantly associated with a greater risk of ATE in patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer, but it was not significantly associated with the risk of VTE. Understanding clinical factors that increase the risk for experiencing ATE/VTE is essential to mitigate the risks and reduce the burden of these prevalent complications in cancer care.'

Sixty-two eyes received intravitreal injections of bevacizumab and 60 eyes received intravitreal injections of ranibizumab monthly for 3 months. Serum D-dimer levels were measured in patients before intravitreal injection and 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months thereafter.RESULTS:  Serum D-dimer levels were not significantly altered following injection of either bevacizumab or ranibizumab. Subgroup analysis for patients at risk for thromboembolic events revealed that serum D-dimer levels showed no significant change after injection of ranibizumab. However, D-dimer levels significantly increased at 1 day (P=0.041) and 1 week (P=0.022) after injection of bevacizumab.S:  Serum D-dimer levels were not changed after injection with either bevacizumab or ranibizumab.

S'"" To evaluate the effectiveness of subconjunctival bevacizumab and topical bevacizumab in preventing neovascularisation on high-risk corneal grafts.METHODS:  The randomised, controlled, parallel group study was carried out from February 2008 to April 2012 at Isra Postgraduate Institute of Ophthalmology and Yasin Eye Hospital, Karachi. Eyes with high-risk corneal transplantation with corneal neovascularisation were included in the trial. Patients were randomly allocated to 3 groups: A, B and C. After penetrating keratoplasty, Group A patients received subconjunctival bevacizumab (2.5 mg/ 0.1 ml), Group B, patients received sham injection, while Group C patients received topical bevacizumab (2.5%, 25 mg/ml). lt was self-administered 4 times a day for 24 weeks. Group B was the control group. Corneal neovascular invasion area was measured using mathematical software programme Mat Lab. Data analyses were done using SPSS version 19.RESULTS:  Of the total 122 patients, there were 41 (33.88%) each in Group A and B, while Group C had 40 (32.78%) patients. Among the 3 groups, mean corneal neovascular invasion area was minimum in Group A (n = 3; 6.23%), while in Group B it was 12.3% (n = 5). Group C had the maximum corneal neovascular invasion area after 24 weks (n = 11; 26.7%). Maximum number of patients (n = 36; 87.80%) attained visual acuity of 6/36 or better in Group Afollowed by Group C (n = 26; 65%) and Group B (n = 17; 41.46%).: "" Subconjunctival bevacizumab reduces the recurrence of neovascularisation and, thus, helps increasing the frequency of graft survival in cases of high-risk corneal transplants.

S' Antiangiogenic therapy is routinely used in a variety of cancer entities. Hypertension is the most common side effect of all currently available antiangiogenic treatments.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  In this prospective observational clinical trial, we investigated risk factors for blood pressure elevation in patients exposed to an antiangiogenic agent and explored the correlation between hypertension and the duration of antiangiogenic treatment.RESULTS:  In 169 patients, pre-existing antihypertensive medication was the most prominent risk factor associated with increased blood pressure during therapy. Between visits 1 and 3, the median systolic blood pressure increased by 10.85 mmHg in patients with pre-existing hypertension receiving antihypertensive medication while it increased by only 2.69 mmHg in patients without hypertension. The median increase in diastolic pressure was 7.28 versus 0.11 mmHg in patients with versus without pre-existing hypertension. Increases in blood pressure occurred early (within 6 weeks of starting therapy). In spite of this significant increase in the blood pressure, no major bleeding events or other related complications were observed during antiangiogenic therapy.S:  Pre-existing hypertension and treatment with antihypertensive medication correlated with a more pronounced increase in blood pressure. Thus, intensified antihypertensive therapy might be warranted early during bevacizumab therapy in patients already receiving antihypertensive treatment.'

Patients were randomly assigned via a central computerised minimisation procedure to three cycles of docetaxel (100 mg/m(2) once every 21 days) followed by three cycles of fluorouracil (500 mg/m(2)), epirubicin (100 mg/m(2)), and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m(2)) once every 21 days (D-FEC), without or with four cycles of bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) (Bev+D-FEC). The primary endpoint was pathological complete response, defined as the absence of invasive disease in the breast and axillary lymph nodes, analysed by intention to treat. The trial has completed and follow-up is ongoing. This trial is registered with EudraCT (2008-002322-11), ISRCTN (68502941), and ClinicalTrials.gov (<a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01093235" title="See in ClincalTrials.gov"NCT01093235</a).FINDINGS: "FINDINGS" Between May 7, 2009, and Jan 9, 2013, we randomly allocated 800 participants to D-FEC (n=401) and Bev+D-FEC (n=399). 781 patients were available for the primary endpoint analysis. Significantly more patients in the bevacizumab group achieved a pathological complete response compared with those treated with chemotherapy alone: 87 (22%, 95% CI 18-27) of 388 patients in the Bev+D-FEC group compared with 66 (17%, 13-21) of 393 patients in the D-FEC group (p=0\xc2\xb703). Grade 3 and 4 toxicities were reported at expected levels in both groups, although more patients had grade 4 neutropenia in the Bev+D-FEC group than in the D-FEC group (85 [22%] vs 68 [17%]).INTERPRETATION: "INTERPRETATION" Addition of four cycles of bevacizumab to D-FEC in HER2-negative early breast cancer significantly improved pathological complete response. However, whether the improvement in pathological complete response will lead to improved disease-free and overall survival outcomes is unknown and will be reported after longer follow-up. Meta-analysis of available neoadjuvant trials is likely to be the only way to define subgroups of early breast cancer that would have clinically significant long-term benefit from bevacizumab treatment.FUNDING: "FUNDING" Cancer Research UK, Roche, Sanofi-Aventis.'

S'"" Low-grade serous (LGS) ovarian and primary peritoneal cancer is a rare disease with limited therapeutic options. Low response rates are observed with cytotoxic chemotherapy. However, significant responses have been reported in patients treated with bevacizumab. The objective of this study was to determine the response rate to bevacizumab with or without concurrent chemotherapy in patients with recurrent serous borderline or LGS ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer.METHODS:  This single-institution retrospective study examined the response rate to treatment with bevacizumab in patients with serous borderline or LGS cancer. Patients were treated at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between 2005 and 2012. The best overall response was determined with the use of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors.RESULTS:  A total of 17 patients were identified, 15 of whom were evaluable for the primary end point of best overall response. Two patients were treated with bevacizumab as a single agent, and the remainder received bevacizumab in conjunction with chemotherapy (paclitaxel, topotecan, oral cyclophosphamide, gemcitabine, or gemcitabine and carboplatin). The median duration of bevacizumab administration in evaluable patients was 23 weeks (mean, 32.2 weeks; range, 6-79.4 weeks). There were no complete responses. Partial responses were observed in 6 patients (5 patients received concurrent paclitaxel, and 1 patient received concurrent gemcitabine). The overall response rate was 40%, with a response rate of 55% among the subgroup of patients with LGS cancer.S:  These results indicate that bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy is an active treatment for recurrent LGS ovarian cancer. A prospective trial of bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of LGS ovarian cancer should be considered.'

S'"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE" Antiangiogenic therapies, such as bevacizumab, decrease contrast enhancement and FLAIR hyperintensity in patients with high-grade gliomas in a manner that may not correlate with actual tumor response. This study evaluated the ability of an advanced DWI technique, restriction spectrum imaging, to improve conspicuity within regions of restricted diffusion compared with ADC in patients treated with bevacizumab and to demonstrate that unlike ADC, restriction spectrum imaging is less affected by bevacizumab-induced reductions in FLAIR hyperintensity.: "" Restriction spectrum imaging cellularity maps and DWI were available for 12 patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas at baseline and following initiation of bevacizumab. VOIs were drawn for regions of restricted diffusion, surrounding FLAIR hyperintensity, and normal-appearing white matter; and intensity values within regions of restricted diffusion and FLAIR hyperintensity were normalized to normal-appearing white matter. Normalized values were compared between restriction spectrum imaging cellularity maps and ADC at baseline and on treatment by using repeated-measures ANOVA.RESULTS:  All patients exhibited decreases in contrast enhancement and FLAIR hyperintensity following treatment. Normalized intensity values were higher on restriction spectrum imaging cellularity maps compared with ADC in regions of restricted diffusion, whereas intensity values were higher on ADC compared with restriction spectrum imaging cellularity maps in regions of FLAIR hyperintensity. Bevacizumab-induced decreases in FLAIR hyperintensity had a greater effect on ADC than on the restriction spectrum imaging cellularity maps, with the relative sensitivity of ADC to changes in FLAIR hyperintensity being >20 times higher than that on restriction spectrum imaging cellularity maps.S:  Restriction spectrum imaging is less influenced by reductions in FLAIR hyperintensity compared with ADC, which may confer an advantage of restriction spectrum imaging over ADC for interpreting tumor response on imaging following antiangiogenic therapy.'

S' Preoperative radiochemotherapy (RCT) is a standard of care for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC; stages II and III). Results of our phase II study (BevXelOx-RT) have shown that this regimen is feasible but without a significant improvement of pathological complete response. Whether preoperatively administered bevacizumab, due to its specific toxicity profile, leads to increased rates of surgical complications is currently a subject for debate. This analysis focusses on the surgery-associated spectrum of complications.METHODS:  Data from 62 patients with rectal cancer (uT3-4; N0/1, M0) of the phase II trial were analyzed. Patients received radiotherapy (50.4/1.8 Gy fractions), simultaneous bevacizumab 5 mg/kg (d1, d15, d29), and capecitabine 825 mg/m(2) twice daily (d1-14, d22-35), oxaliplatin 50 mg/m(2) (d1, d8, d22, d29). Four to six weeks after RCT, surgical resection was performed.RESULTS:  Overall, 69/69 patients underwent surgery, and 66 (95.7 %) patients had R0 resection. Surgery was mainly conducted (in 66 %) by highly experienced surgeons (>20 resections of rectal cancer/year) with differences between the institutions due to the operative procedures but without effects on the rate of R0 resection or complications. The average duration of surgery was 239 min (\xc2\xb110). Frequency of multivisceral resections (11 %), intraoperative (8 %) and postoperative (43 %) complications were all in the expected range. In particular, we did not observe an increased rate of postoperative bleedings (3 %). The postoperative mortality rate was 0 %.S:  Quantity and the kind of surgery-associated spectrum of complications followed by a preoperative bevacizumab-containing RCT regimen in patients with LARC were in line with comparable trials of bevacizumab-based approaches.'

S'The international phase IIIb study, ATHENA assessed the combination of bevacizumab/taxane-based chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer (mBC) in real-life setting. Among the 365 patients included in France, median overall survival (OS) is 28.4 months (CI95% 24.8-33.0), with a median time from treatment start to end of study of 36,5 months (25,1-45,4). Exploratory analyses in three sub-groups show that the median OS in long responder patients (not progressing for at least one year; n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89116) is not reached. In responder patients (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89308), median OS is 33.0 months (CI95% 28.6-37.4) and 12.4 months (CI95% 11.2-17.4) in non-responders (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8941). In patients with mBC expressing hormone receptors (HR+), treated with first-line hormone therapy before inclusion (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8987) median OS in is 23.2 months (CI95% 19.6-28.6), and 35.3 months (CI95% 32.2-not reached); P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.004 in patients treated first with chemotherapy\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89bevacizumab (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89179).

S'"S" This study aims to determine the efficacy and tolerability of capecitabine (CAP) plus bevacizumab (BEV) as treatment for frontline metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in frail and/or elderly patients.: "" This was an open label, multi-site, single arm, phase II study in frontline mCRC. In this study, patients (pts) who were frail (ECOG 2) or older patients with ECOG 1 performance status (PS) received CAP (1000 mg/m(2) bid, 14 days of every 21 days) plus BEV (7.5mg/kg iv once every 21 days). The primary objective was progression free survival (PFS). Secondary objectives were overall response rate (ORR) and toxicity.RESULTS:  In terms of patients: 50 were enrolled; 5 withdrew consent prior to treatment; 45 were treated, and 41 were evaluable. The mean age was 75.9 (range 54-93) and 62% had an ECOG 2 PS. The median PFS was 6.87 months (95% CI, 5.1-11.5 months) and median overall survival was 12.7 months (95% CI, 6.9-12.7 months). The most common grades 3-4 toxicities were: diarrhea (17.8%), fatigue (13.3%), hand-foot syndrome (13.3%), dehydration (8.9%), hypertension (6.7%) and vomiting (6.7%).S:  The results of this trial support the use of CAP plus BEV as first-line treatment for frail/elderly patients with metastatic CRC. The ORR (40%) is comparable to pooled data in elderly on fluorouracil (5-FU)+BEV. The median PFS (7.2 months) in this study is slightly lower than that seen with 5-FU+BEV but this study had a high percentage of ECOG PS 2 patients. Side effects were manageable with no new safety signals.'

S'"" Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) status were identified as prognostic factors for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with chemotherapy and bevacizumab in analyses of the MACRO (Maintenance Treatment in Advanced Colorectal Cancer) trial. In this post hoc analysis of the MACRO trial, the potential additive effect of these 2 factors on patient outcomes was explored.METHODS:  A total of 158 of the 480 patients involved in the MACRO trial were included in the biological marker substudy. CTC isolation and enumeration were centralized and performed using the CellSearch System (Veridex LLC, Raritan, NJ) in 7.5 mL of whole blood. Evaluation of KRAS status was performed retrospectively by the standard method used at each center. PFS and OS were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method according to CTC count and KRAS status.RESULTS:  Patients with < 3 CTC per 7.5 mL blood at baseline and KRAS wild-type tumors had a median PFS of 14.2 months compared with 6.2 months in patients with \xe2\x89\xa5 3 CTCs and KRAS mutated tumors (P < .0001; hazard ratio, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.8-5.2). Similar findings were observed for OS (28.9 and 13.7 months, respectively, P = .0004; hazard ratio 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-4.9). Multivariate analyses showed that CTC count \xe2\x89\xa5 3 and KRAS status were the only independent prognostic factors for both PFS and OS.S:  This post hoc analysis showed that CTC count and KRAS status were independent prognostic factors for outcomes in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with bevacizumab \xc2\xb1 chemotherapy.

S' In locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) preoperative chemoradiation (CRT) is the standard of care, but the risk of local recurrence is low with good quality total mesorectal excision (TME), although many still develop metastatic disease. Current challenges in treating rectal cancer include the development of effective organ-preserving approaches and the prevention of subsequent metastatic disease. Neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy (NACT) alone may reduce local and systemic recurrences, and may be more effective than postoperative treatments which often have poor compliance. Investigation of intensified NACT is warranted to improve outcomes for patients with LARC. The objective is to evaluate feasibility and efficacy of a four-drug regimen containing bevacizumab prior to surgical resection.METHODS/DESIGN: "METHODS/DESIGN" This is a multi-centre, randomized phase II trial. Eligible patients must have histologically confirmed LARC with distal part of the tumour 4-12 cm from anal verge, no metastases, and poor prognostic features on pelvic MRI. Sixty patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive folinic acid + flurourcil + oxaliplatin (FOLFOX)\xe2\x80\x89+ bevacizumab (BVZ) or FOLFOX\xe2\x80\x89+ irinotecan (FOLFOXIRI)\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89BVZ, given in 2 weekly cycles for up to 6 cycles prior to TME. Patients stop treatment if they fail to respond after 3 cycles (defined as \xe2\x89\xa5 30 % decrease in Standardised Uptake Value (SUV) compared to baseline PET/CT). The primary endpoint is pathological complete response rate. Secondary endpoints include objective response rate, MRI tumour regression grade, involved circumferential resection margin rate, T and N stage downstaging, progression-free survival, disease-free survival, overall survival, local control, 1-year colostomy rate, acute toxicity, compliance to chemotherapy.DISCUSSION: "DISCUSSION" In LARC, a neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen - if feasible, effective and tolerable would be suitable for testing as the novel arm against the current standards of short course preoperative radiotherapy (SCPRT) and/or fluorouracil (5FU)-based CRT in a future randomised phase III trial.'

S' To report the 6-month comparative outcomes and bleb morphology for needle revision with bevacizumab and mitomycin C (MMC) versus MMC alone of failed trabeculectomy and ExPRESS shunt blebs.METHODS:  Patients undergoing bleb needle revision procedures were enrolled in this study. All patients received a subconjunctival injection of 0.1 mL MMC (0.4 mg/mL) mixed with 0.1 mL preservative-free lidocaine (1%) at the beginning of the procedure. The patients were randomized into 2 cohorts assigned to receive either 1.0 mg (0.04 mL of 25 mg/mL) subconjunctival bevacizumab (treatment group) or 0.04 mL of balanced salt solution (control group) injected in an identical manner posterior to the bleb after the bleb needling. Success was defined as \xe2\x89\xa520% reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP) without any IOP-lowering medications. Qualified success was defined as \xe2\x89\xa520% reduction of IOP with IOP-lowering medications. Failure was defined as IOP>21 mm Hg, IOP reduction <20%, or need for additional surgery. Bleb morphology was classified using the Indiana Bleb Appearance Grading Scale.RESULTS:  Six months postoperatively, in treatment group (n=29), 57% of patients achieved complete success, and 43% failed. In control group (n=29), 41% of patients achieved complete success, 7% achieved qualified success, and 52% failed. The difference in success rates between the 2 groups was not statistically significant (P=0.35). At 6 months, the mean IOP was 11.52 in treatment group and 12.83 in control group (P=0.45); patients in treatment group were on a mean of 0.16 medications as compared with 0.58 medications in control group (P=0.058). For bleb morphology of treatment group compared with control group, the blebs had less vascularity (0.76 vs. 1.20, respectively, on a scale of 0 to 4, P<0.05) and greater extent (2.68 vs. 2.36, on a scale of 0 to 3, P=0.022) in treatment group.S:  There was no significant difference between the success rates and IOPs at postoperative month 6 between treatment and control groups. Postoperative blebs in the treatment group were less vascular and had greater extent.'

S' RTOG 0625/ACRIN 6677 is a multicenter, randomized, phase II trial of bevacizumab with irinotecan or temozolomide in recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). This study investigated whether early posttreatment progression on FLAIR or postcontrast MRI assessed by central reading predicts overall survival (OS).METHODS:  Of 123 enrolled patients, 107 had baseline and at least 1 posttreatment MRI. Two central neuroradiologists serially measured bidimensional (2D) and volumetric (3D) enhancement on postcontrast T1-weighted images and volume of FLAIR hyperintensity. Progression status on all posttreatment MRIs was determined using Macdonald and RANO imaging threshold criteria, with a third neuroradiologist adjudicating discrepancies of both progression occurrence and timing. For each MRI pulse sequence, Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and log-rank test were used to compare OS between cases with or without radiologic progression.RESULTS:  Radiologic progression occurred after 2 chemotherapy cycles (8 weeks) in 9 of 97 (9%), 9 of 73 (12%), and 11 of 98 (11%) 2D-T1, 3D-T1, and FLAIR cases, respectively, and 34 of 80 (43%), 21 of 58 (36%), and 37 of 79 (47%) corresponding cases after 4 cycles (16 weeks). Median OS among patients progressing at 8 or 16 weeks was significantly less than that among nonprogressors, as determined on 2D-T1 (114 vs 278 days and 214 vs 426 days, respectively; P < .0001 for both) and 3D-T1 (117 vs 306 days [P < .0001] and 223 vs 448 days [P = .0003], respectively) but not on FLAIR (201 vs 276 days [P = .38] and 303 vs 321 days [P = .13], respectively).: "" Early progression on 2D-T1 and 3D-T1, but not FLAIR MRI, after 8 and 16 weeks of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy has highly significant prognostic value for OS in recurrent GBM.'

S'"S/HYPOTHESIS" The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intralesional bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor, in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated Kaposi\'s sarcoma of the upper airway receiving antiretroviral therapy.STUDY DESIGN: "STUDY DESIGN" A pilot randomized, open, phase II study.METHODS:  HIV-infected patients with Kaposi\'s sarcoma lesions of the upper airway in the T0 stage were randomized to receive antiretroviral therapy alone or antiretroviral therapy with intralesional bevacizumab. The primary end point was the assessment of changes in tumor size according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST); the secondary end point was safety.RESULTS:  Of the 14 patients with Kaposi\'s sarcoma included in the study, seven were assigned to the bevacizumab group and seven to the control group. The median age was 30.5 years (interquartile range [IQR], 24.7-38.2). Four patients (28.5%) had >150 CD4 T cells/mm(3). Nine patients had lesions in the oral cavity; three patients had pharyngeal disease; one patient had laryngeal involvement; and one patient had oral cavity, pharyngeal, and laryngeal involvement. Four patients had complete response (28.5%), two had partial response, six had stable disease, and two had progressive disease. The median time to complete response was 13 weeks (IQR, 7.5-36.5). No statistical differences between groups were observed (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89.124). In the bevacizumab group, one patient had a grade I adverse event, and another patient had a grade II adverse event.S:  Intralesional administration of bevacizumab was well tolerated but had no impact on upper respiratory tract Kaposi\'s sarcoma lesions of HIV-infected patients.'

S' To prospectively evaluate the effects of intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB, Avastin; Genentech, Inc., San Francisco, CA) injections in patients with acute central/hemicentral retinal vein occlusions (C/HCRVOs) (\xe2\x89\xa41 month after the occlusion was diagnosed) over the course of 3 years.METHODS:  The study included 57 patients with unilateral acute C/HCRVOs. Initially, the treatment for acute C/HCRVO patients consisted of 4 consecutive IVB injections administered off-label at a dose of 2.5\xe2\x80\x89mg per injection, with each injection spaced \xe2\x88\xbc45 days apart. Thereafter, IVB therapy was flexible, and subsequent injections were administered during scheduled visits whenever a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) loss of \xe2\x89\xa55 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters occurred and/or iris/angle neovascularization appeared (regardless of the intraocular pressure level). Changes in the BCVA and foveal thickness (FT), number of IVB injections administered, and incidence of neovascular glaucoma (NVG) were estimated.RESULTS:  The increase in the BCVA score at month 36 was 17.15 (ETDRS letters) (P<0.0001) in cases of nonischemic and 26.81 (ETDRS letters) (P<0.01) in cases of ischemic occlusions. At the end of the follow-up, the proportion of BCVA score improvements greater than 15 ETDRS letters was similar in patients with both forms of occlusions (measured in 45.5% of nonischemic and 45.8% of ischemic patients) (P=0.977). There were significant reductions in FT from baseline values to 230\xc2\xb140.50\xe2\x80\x89\xce\xbcm (P=0.0001) in patients with nonischemic occlusions and 270\xc2\xb140.50\xe2\x80\x89\xce\xbcm (P=0.0001) in patients with ischemic forms. There was a significant difference (P<0.03) in the number of IVB injections administered in patients with nonischemic C/HCRVOs (8.7\xc2\xb11.58) compared to patients with ischemic occlusions (9.7\xc2\xb11.78). NVG occurred in 2 cases of ischemic occlusions.S:  The 3-year IVB therapy provided sustained vision and FT gains in most phakic patients with acute C/HCRVOs, making this treatment option a rational and viable therapeutic strategy. Bevacizumab was more effective in patients with ischemic occlusions who required a significantly higher number of injections.'

The interim analysis revealed no difference in overall survival (OS; primary end point) between treatment arms; however, progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate were significantly superior with BEV-PAC. We sought to identify patient populations that may be most appropriately treated with one or other regimen.METHODS:  Patients with HER2-negative LR/mBC who had received no prior chemotherapy for advanced disease were randomised to either BEV-PAC (bevacizumab 10 mg kg(-1) days 1 and 15 plus paclitaxel 90 mg m(-2) days 1, 8 and 15 q4w) or BEV-CAP (bevacizumab 15 mg kg(-1) day 1 plus capecitabine 1000 mg m(-2) bid days 1-14 q3w). The study population was categorised into three cohorts: triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), high-risk hormone receptor-positive (HR+) and low-risk HR+. High- and low-risk HR+ were defined, respectively, as having \xe2\xa9\xbe2 vs \xe2\xa9\xbd1 of the following four risk factors: disease-free interval \xe2\xa9\xbd24 months; visceral metastases; prior (neo)adjuvant anthracycline and/or taxane; and metastases in \xe2\xa9\xbe3 organs.RESULTS:  The treatment effect on OS differed between cohorts. Non-significant OS trends favoured BEV-PAC in the TNBC cohort and BEV-CAP in the low-risk HR+ cohort. In all three cohorts, there was a non-significant PFS trend favouring BEV-PAC. Grade \xe2\xa9\xbe3 adverse events were consistently less common with BEV-CAP.'

S' To evaluate and compare the effects of single intravitreal injection of ranibizumab and bevacizumab on central retinal and choroidal thickness in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD).METHODS:  Forty eyes of 40 patients with neovascular AMD that underwent intravitreal injection of vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors (anti-VEGFs) were included. Patients were randomized into 2 groups: 20 eyes received ranibizumab and 20 eyes received bevacizumab injection. Central retinal and choroidal thicknesses of all eyes at baseline and 1 month postinjection scans were measured with Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT). Student t test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare the data.RESULTS:  The mean central retinal thickness (CRT) showed significant decrease after single injection of ranibizumab (from 345.0 \xc2\xb5m to 253.5 \xc2\xb5m, p&amp;lt;0.01) and bevacizumab (from 329.5 \xc2\xb5m to 251.0 \xc2\xb5m, p&amp;lt;0.01) at the first month, respectively. There was no significant difference regarding the CRT change between groups (p = 0.39). The mean choroidal thickness decreased from 158.6 \xc2\xb5m (115-317) to 155.5 \xc2\xb5m (111-322) in the ranibizumab group and from 211.5 \xc2\xb5m (143-284) to 201.5 \xc2\xb5m (93-338) in bevacizumab group. The decrease was not significant between groups (p = 0.35).S:  Intravitreal injection of both ranibizumab and bevacizumab provided a significant decrease in CRT; however, the agents caused no significant change in choroidal thickness. Additionally, no difference between ranibizumab versus bevacizumab was observed related to macular edema inhibition.'

S' Endoglin, an endothelial cell membrane receptor expressed on angiogenic tumor vessels, is essential for angiogenesis and upregulated in the setting of VEGF inhibition. TRC105 is an anti-endoglin IgG1 monoclonal antibody that potentiates VEGF inhibitors in preclinical models. This study assessed safety, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of TRC105 in combination with bevacizumab.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN" Patients (n = 38) with advanced solid tumors, Eastern Cooperative Group performance status 0-1, and normal organ function were treated with escalating doses of TRC105 plus bevacizumab until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity using a standard 3 + 3 phase I design.RESULTS:  TRC105 and bevacizumab were well tolerated at their recommended single-agent doses (10 mg/kg) when the initial dose of TRC105 was delayed by one week and divided over 2 days to limit the frequency of headache. The concurrent administration of bevacizumab and TRC105 did not otherwise potentiate known toxicities of TRC105 or bevacizumab. Hypertension and proteinuria were observed, though not at rates expected for single-agent bevacizumab. Several patients who had previously progressed on bevacizumab or VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (VEGFR TKI) treatment experienced reductions in tumor volume, including two partial responses by RECIST, and 6 remained without progression for longer periods than during their prior VEGF inhibitor therapy.S:  TRC105 was well tolerated with bevacizumab and clinical activity was observed in a VEGF inhibitor-refractory population. Ongoing clinical trials are testing TRC105 in combination with bevacizumab in glioblastoma and with VEGFR TKIs in renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and soft tissue sarcoma.'

S' The ICON7 trial previously reported improved progression-free survival in women with ovarian cancer with the addition of bevacizumab to standard chemotherapy, with the greatest effect in patients at high risk of disease progression. We report the final overall survival results of the trial.METHODS:  ICON7 was an international, phase 3, open-label, randomised trial undertaken at 263 centres in 11 countries across Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Eligible adult women with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer that was either high-risk early-stage disease (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] stage I-IIa, grade 3 or clear cell histology) or more advanced disease (FIGO stage IIb-IV), with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to standard chemotherapy (six 3-weekly cycles of intravenous carboplatin [AUC 5 or 6] and paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) of body surface area) or the same chemotherapy regimen plus bevacizumab 7\xc2\xb75 mg per kg bodyweight intravenously every 3 weeks, given concurrently and continued with up to 12 further 3-weekly cycles of maintenance therapy. Randomisation was done by a minimisation algorithm stratified by FIGO stage, residual disease, interval between surgery and chemotherapy, and Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup group. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival; the study was also powered to detect a difference in overall survival. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN91273375.FINDINGS: "FINDINGS" Between Dec 18, 2006, and Feb 16, 2009, 1528 women were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy (n=764) or chemotherapy plus bevacizumab (n=764). Median follow-up at the end of the trial on March 31, 2013, was 48\xc2\xb79 months (IQR 26\xc2\xb76-56\xc2\xb72), at which point 714 patients had died (352 in the chemotherapy group and 362 in the bevacizumab group). Our results showed evidence of non-proportional hazards, so we used the difference in restricted mean survival time as the primary estimate of effect. No overall survival benefit of bevacizumab was recorded (restricted mean survival time 44\xc2\xb76 months [95% CI 43\xc2\xb72-45\xc2\xb79] in the standard chemotherapy group vs 45\xc2\xb75 months [44\xc2\xb72-46\xc2\xb77] in the bevacizumab group; log-rank p=0\xc2\xb785). In an exploratory analysis of a predefined subgroup of 502 patients with poor prognosis disease, 332 (66%) died (174 in the standard chemotherapy group and 158 in the bevacizumab group), and a significant difference in overall survival was noted between women who received bevacizumab plus chemotherapy and those who received chemotherapy alone (restricted mean survival time 34\xc2\xb75 months [95% CI 32\xc2\xb70-37\xc2\xb70] with standard chemotherapy vs 39\xc2\xb73 months [37\xc2\xb70-41\xc2\xb77] with bevacizumab; log-rank p=0\xc2\xb703). However, in non-high-risk patients, the restricted mean survival time did not differ significantly between the two treatment groups (49\xc2\xb77 months [95% CI 48\xc2\xb73-51\xc2\xb71]) in the standard chemotherapy group vs 48\xc2\xb74 months [47\xc2\xb70-49\xc2\xb79] in the bevacizumab group; p=0\xc2\xb720). An updated analysis of progression-free survival showed no difference between treatment groups. During extended follow-up, one further treatment-related grade 3 event (gastrointestinal fistula in a bevacizumab-treated patient), three grade 2 treatment-related events (cardiac failure, sarcoidosis, and foot fracture, all in bevacizumab-treated patients), and one grade 1 treatment-related event (vaginal haemorrhage, in a patient treated with standard chemotherapy) were reported.INTERPRETATION: "INTERPRETATION" Bevacizumab, added to platinum-based chemotherapy, did not increase overall survival in the study population as a whole. However, an overall survival benefit was recorded in poor-prognosis patients, which is concordant with the progression-free survival results from ICON7 and GOG-218, and provides further evidence towards the optimum use of bevacizumab in the treatment of ovarian cancer.FUNDING: "FUNDING" The National Institute for Health Research through the UK National Cancer Research Network, the Medical Research Council, and Roche.'

S' Studies done in Asia have shown that a regimen of S-1 plus oxaliplatin (SOX) has promising efficacy and safety in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. We aimed to establish whether SOX plus bevacizumab is non-inferior to mFOLFOX6 (modified regimen of leucovorin, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin) plus bevacizumab as first-line chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer.METHODS:  We undertook an open-label, non-inferiority, randomised phase 3 trial in 82 sites in Japan. We enrolled individuals aged 20-80 years who had metastatic colorectal cancer, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, had assessable lesions, had received no previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy, could take drugs orally, and had adequate organ function. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab (on day 1 of each 2-week cycle, 5 mg/kg intravenous infusion of bevacizumab and a simultaneous intravenous infusion of 85 mg/m(2) oxaliplatin, 200 mg/m(2)l-leucovorin, 400 mg/m(2) bolus fluorouracil, and 2400 mg/m(2) infusional fluorouracil) or SOX plus bevacizumab (on day 1 of each 3-week cycle, 7\xc2\xb75 mg/kg intravenous infusion of bevacizumab and 130 mg/m(2) intravenous infusion of oxaliplatin; assigned dose of S-1 twice a day from after dinner on day 1 to after breakfast on day 15, followed by 7-day break). Randomisation was done centrally with the minimisation method, with stratification by institution and whether postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy had been given. Participants, investigators, and data analysts were not masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), which was defined as the interval between enrolment and progressive disease (\xe2\x89\xa520% increase in sum of longest dimensions of target lesions from baseline, or appearance of new lesions) or death, whichever came first. The primary analysis was done by modified intention to treat. This trial is registered with the Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center, number JapicCTI-090699.FINDINGS: "FINDINGS" Between Feb 1, 2009, and March 31, 2011, 512 patients underwent randomisation. 256 patients assigned to receive SOX plus bevacizumab and 255 assigned to receive mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab were included in the primary analysis. Median PFS was 11\xc2\xb75 months (95% CI 10\xc2\xb77-13\xc2\xb72) in the group assigned to mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab and 11\xc2\xb77 months (10\xc2\xb77-12\xc2\xb79) in the group assigned to SOX plus bevacizumab (HR 1\xc2\xb704, 95% CI 0\xc2\xb786-1\xc2\xb727; less than non-inferiority margin of 1\xc2\xb733, pnon-inferiority=0\xc2\xb7014). The most common haematological adverse events of grade 3 or higher were leucopenia (21 [8%] of 249 patients given mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab included in safety analysis vs six [2%] of 250 given SOX plus bevacizumab; p=0\xc2\xb70029) and neutropenia (84 [34%] vs 22 [9%]; p<0\xc2\xb70001). Grade 3 or higher anorexia (13 [5%] vs three [1%]; p=0\xc2\xb7019) and diarrhoea (23 [9%] vs seven [3%]; p=0\xc2\xb70040) were significantly more common in patients given SOX plus bevacizumab than in those given mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab. We recorded seven treatment-related deaths (three in the group given mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab; four in that given SOX plus bevacizumab).INTERPRETATION: "INTERPRETATION" SOX plus bevacizumab is non-inferior to mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab with respect to PFS as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer, and could become standard treatment in Asian populations.FUNDING: "FUNDING" Taiho.'

Randomly, subject\'s eyes underwent primary trabeculectomy with either subconjunctival bevacizumab (2.5 mg/0.1 mL) or topical MMC (0.2 mg/mL for 3 min). The intraocular pressure (IOP) was the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures included the corrected distance visual acuity, number of antiglaucoma medications, postoperative interventions and complications, bleb evaluation (on the basis of Moorfields Bleb Grading System), and the percentage of eyes achieving target pressure of 21, 18, 15, and 12 mm Hg at 6 and 12 months postoperatively.RESULTS:  Of the 42 eyes, 21 treated with subconjunctival bevacizumab while 21 were treated with MMC. The mean preoperative IOP in the bevacizumab group improved from 23.9 \xc2\xb1 2.7 mm Hg with 2.6 \xc2\xb1 0.7 antiglaucoma medications to 13.9 \xc2\xb1 2.8 mm Hg with 0.6 \xc2\xb1 0.9 antiglaucoma medications at 12 months (P<0.001 and P<0.001, respectively).

S' Neoadjuvant anthracycline- and taxane-based chemotherapy is frequently administered in breast cancer. Pathological complete response (pCR) rates vary according to clinical disease stage and biology of breast cancer. The critical role of angiogenesis in the progression of breast cancer, together with significantly improved efficacy when bevacizumab is combined with chemotherapy in the metastatic setting, provides a strong rationale for evaluating the integration of bevacizumab into neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens.METHODS:  A single-arm, multicentre, phase II, open-label study evaluated four 3-weekly cycles of FEC (5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m(2), epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2)) followed by 12 cycles of weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2)) in combination with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks as neoadjuvant therapy for HER2-negative stage III locally advanced or inflammatory breast carcinoma. The primary endpoint was pCR rate.RESULTS:  Planned treatment was completed in 49 of the 56 enrolled patients. In the intent-to-treat population, the pCR rate was 21% and the clinical response rate was 59%. Breast-conserving surgery was achieved in 34% of patients. In the subgroup of 15 patients with triple-negative disease, the pCR rate was 47%. Grade 3 adverse events in \xe2\x89\xa55% of patients were neutropenia, leucopenia, asthenia, and rash. One case each of hypertensive retinopathy and post-operative wound complication, both after treatment completion, were considered probably related to bevacizumab. There were no treatment-related deaths and no cardiac function abnormalities.S:  This study indicates that FEC followed by weekly paclitaxel with bevacizumab is an active neoadjuvant regimen for locally advanced breast cancer, with no major safety concerns.'

To seek effective methods, we examine the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab plus FOLFIRI as a second-line chemotherapy in Chinese patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). A total of 55 patients with previous failure of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy were included in this study, from October 2010 to February 2012. All patients received bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) plus FOLFIRI every other week until disease progression or intolerable toxicity occurred. The response rate was 31%, and the disease-controlled rate was 76.4%. The median progression-free survival was 6 months, and the median overall survival was 17 months. Adverse events (AEs) related to chemotherapy were mild to moderate. Only the incidence of grade 3-4 neutropenia reached to 25.5%. The incidence of AEs related to bevacizumab was low. These AEs included grade 3-4 toxicities of hypertension and proteinuria 5.4 and 3.6%, respectively.

During the course of neoadjuvant therapy, 3 patients (12\xc2\xa0%) had grade 4 hematological toxicity events and 12 (48\xc2\xa0%) had grade 3 non-hematological toxicity events. According to RECIST criteria, 18 patients (72\xc2\xa0%) achieved partial response and the rest seven patients (28\xc2\xa0%) remained stable disease. Two patients (8\xc2\xa0%) refused the subsequent surgical therapy for personal reasons, and 23 patients (92\xc2\xa0%) underwent operations finally. Nine (39.1\xc2\xa0%, 95\xc2\xa0% CI 18.0-57.5\xc2\xa0%) of them achieved pathologic complete response. Five of them (21.7\xc2\xa0%) had postoperative complications. After a median follow-up period of 25.3 (14.4-40.9) months, four patients developed disease progression and two died of cancer. The 3-year overall survival rate was 95\xc2\xa0% (95\xc2\xa0% CI 69.5-99.3\xc2\xa0%), and the 3-year disease-free survival rate was 72.5\xc2\xa0% (95\xc2\xa0% CI 33.7-90.9\xc2\xa0%).S:  Sandwich-like neoadjuvant therapy with bevacizumab is safe and effective for locally advanced rectal cancer.'

S' Bevacizumab has broad anti-tumour activity, but substantial risk of hypertension. No reliable markers are available for predicting bevacizumab-induced hypertension.METHODS:  A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed in the phase III bevacizumab-based adjuvant breast cancer trial, ECOG-5103, to evaluate for an association between genotypes and hypertension. GWAS was conducted in those who had experienced systolic blood pressure (SBP) >160\xe2\x80\x89mm\xe2\x80\x89Hg during therapy using binary analysis and a cumulative dose model for the total exposure of bevacizumab. Common toxicity criteria (CTC) grade 3-5 hypertension was also assessed. Candidate SNP validation was performed in the randomised phase III trial, ECOG-2100.RESULTS:  When using the phenotype of SBP>160\xe2\x80\x89mm\xe2\x80\x89Hg, the most significant association in SV2C (rs6453204) approached and met genome-wide significance in the binary model (P=6.0 \xc3\x97 10(-8); OR=3.3) and in the cumulative dose model (P=4.7 \xc3\x97 10(-8); HR=2.2), respectively. Similar associations with rs6453204 were seen for CTC grade 3-5 hypertension but did not meet genome-wide significance. Validation study from ECOG-2100 demonstrated a statistically significant association between this SNP and grade 3/4 hypertension using the binary model (P-value=0.037; OR=2.4).S:  A genetic variant in SV2C predicted clinically relevant bevacizumab-induced hypertension in two independent, randomised phase III trials.'

S' We hypothesized that vertical blockade of VEGF signaling by combining bevacizumab with sorafenib in patients with recurrent glioblastoma would result in a synergistic therapeutic effect. We also investigated whether VEGF, VEGFR2 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1\xce\xb1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), circulating biomarkers of angiogenesis, and MRI markers such as apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) are correlated with treatment efficacy and/or toxicity.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN" Patients received bevacizumab (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks) with sorafenib (200 mg twice a day, weekly, days 1-5; group A). Due to toxicity, the starting sorafenib dose was subsequently modified to 200 mg every day (group B).RESULTS:  Fifty-four patients were enrolled: 19 patients in group A and 35 in group B. Objective response rate was 18.5% with median duration of 6.7 months (range 0.5-24.1 months). Six-month progression-free survival (PFS6) was 20.4% (11/54), and median overall survival (OS) was 5.6 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 4.7-8.2]; outcome was similar between the two dose groups. We identified SNPs in the VEGF and VEGFR2 promoter regions, which were associated with PFS6 (P<0.022). Among molecular markers of angiogenesis, a higher log2 baseline level of stromal cell-derived factor-1 was associated with PFS6 success (P=0.04). Circulating endothelial cells decreased during treatment with subsequent increase at disease progression (P=0.022). Imaging analysis showed a trend associating ADC-L with poor outcome.S:  The bevacizumab/sorafenib combination did not improve outcome of patients with recurrent glioblastoma versus historic bevacizumab-treated controls. Biologic markers of response and resistance to bevacizumab in gliomas were identified which merit prospective validation.'

S' To evaluate risk factors for GI adverse events (AEs) within a phase III trial of bevacizumab in first-line ovarian cancer therapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Women with previously untreated advanced disease after surgery were randomly allocated to six cycles of platinum-taxane chemotherapy plus placebo cycles (C)2 to C22 (R1); chemotherapy plus bevacizumab C2 to C6 plus placebo C7 to C22 (R2); or chemotherapy plus bevacizumab C2 to C22 (R3). Patients were evaluated for history or on-study development of potential risk factors for GI AEs defined as grade \xe2\x89\xa5 2 perforation, fistula, necrosis, or hemorrhage.RESULTS:  Of 1,873 patients enrolled, 1,759 (94%) were evaluable, and 2.8% (50 of 1,759) experienced a GI AE: 10 of 587 (1.7%, R1), 20 of 587 (3.4%, R2), and 20 of 585 (3.4%, R3). Univariable analyses indicated that previous treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; P = .005) and small bowel resection (SBR; P = .032) or large bowel resection (LBR; P = .012) at primary surgery were significantly associated with a GI AE. The multivariable estimated relative odds of a GI AE were 13.4 (95% CI, 3.44 to 52.3; P < .001) for IBD; 2.05 (95% CI, 1.09 to 3.88; P = .026) for LBR; 1.95 (95% CI, 0.894 to 4.25; P = .093) for SBR; and 2.15 for bevacizumab exposure (aggregated 95% CI, 1.05 to 4.40; P = .036).: "" History of treatment for IBD, and bowel resection at primary surgery, increase the odds of GI AEs in patients receiving first-line platinum-taxane chemotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer. After accounting for these risk factors, concurrent bevacizumab doubles the odds of a GI AE, but is not appreciably increased by continuation beyond chemotherapy.'

S'"AIM" Treatment of multiresistant epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is palliative and patients who have become resistant after multiple lines of chemotherapy often have an unmet need for further and less toxic treatment. Anti-angiogenic therapy has attracted considerable attention in the treatment of EOC in combination with chemotherapy. However, only a minor subgroup will benefit from the treatment and there is an obvious need for new markers to select such patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of single-agent bevacizumab in multiresistant EOC and the importance of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in predicting treatment response.METHODS:  One hundred and forty-four patients with multi-resistant EOC were treated with single-agent bevacizumab 10mg/kg every three weeks. Baseline plasma samples were analysed for levels of cfDNA by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).RESULTS:  Eighteen percent responded to treatment according to CA125 and 5.6% had partial response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST). Stable disease was seen in 53.5% and 48.6% of the patients by CA125 and RECIST, respectively. Median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 4.2 and 6.7 months, respectively. Cell-free DNA was highly correlated to PFS (p=0.0004) and OS (p=0.005) in both univariate and multivariate analyses (PFS, hazard ratio (HR)=1.98, p=0.002; OS, HR=1.66, p=0.02), as patients with high cfDNA had a poor outcome.S:  Single-agent bevacizumab treatment in multiresistant EOC appears to be a valuable treatment option with acceptable side-effects. Cell-free DNA showed independent prognostic importance in patients treated with bevacizumab and could be applied as an adjunct for treatment selection.'

S'Functional diffusion mapping (fDM) is a cancer imaging technique that quantifies voxelwise changes in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Previous studies have shown value of fDMs in bevacizumab therapy for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The aim of the present study was to implement explicit criteria for diffusion MRI quality control and independently evaluate fDM performance in a multicenter clinical trial (RTOG 0625/ACRIN 6677). A total of 123 patients were enrolled in the current multicenter trial and signed institutional review board-approved informed consent at their respective institutions. MRI was acquired prior to and 8 weeks following therapy. A 5-point QC scoring system was used to evaluate DWI quality. fDM performance was evaluated according to the correlation of these metrics with PFS and OS at the first follow-up time-point. Results showed ADC variability of 7.3% in NAWM and 10.5% in CSF. A total of 68% of patients had usable DWI data and 47% of patients had high quality DWI data when also excluding patients that progressed before the first follow-up. fDM performance was improved by using only the highest quality DWI. High pre-treatment contrast enhancing tumor volume was associated with shorter PFS and OS. A high volume fraction of increasing ADC after therapy was associated with shorter PFS, while a high volume fraction of decreasing ADC was associated with shorter OS. In summary, DWI in multicenter trials are currently of limited value due to image quality. Improvements in consistency of image quality in multicenter trials are necessary for further advancement of DWI biomarkers.'

A standard 3 + 3 dose-escalation trial design was used.RESULTS:  RO5323441 combined with bevacizumab was generally well tolerated, and the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Two participants experienced dose-limiting toxicities (grade 3 meningitis associated with spinal fluid leak [1250 mg] and grade 3 cerebral infarction [2500 mg]). Common adverse events included hypertension (14 participants, 64%), headache (12 participants, 55%), dysphonia (11 participants, 50%) and fatigue (6 participants, 27%).The pharmacokinetics of RO5323441 were linear, over-the-dose range, and bevacizumab exposure was unaffected by RO5323441 coadministration. Modulation of plasmatic angiogenic proteins, with increases in VEGFA and decreases in FLT4, was observed. Dynamic contrast-enhanced/diffusion-weighted MRI revealed large decreases in vascular parameters that were maintained through the dosing period. Combination therapy achieved an overall response rate of 22.7%, including one complete response, and median progression-free and overall survival of 3.5 and 8.5 months, respectively.: "" The toxicity profile of RO5323441 plus bevacizumab was acceptable and manageable.

S' In platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (OC), single-agent chemotherapy is standard. Bevacizumab is active alone and in combination. AURELIA is the first randomized phase III trial to our knowledge combining bevacizumab with chemotherapy in platinum-resistant OC.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Eligible patients had measurable/assessable OC that had progressed < 6 months after completing platinum-based therapy. Patients with refractory disease, history of bowel obstruction, or > two prior anticancer regimens were ineligible. After investigators selected chemotherapy (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, weekly paclitaxel, or topotecan), patients were randomly assigned to single-agent chemotherapy alone or with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks) until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal. Crossover to single-agent bevacizumab was permitted after progression with chemotherapy alone. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) by RECIST. Secondary end points included objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), safety, and patient-reported outcomes.RESULTS:  The PFS hazard ratio (HR) after PFS events in 301 of 361 patients was 0.48 (95% CI, 0.38 to 0.60; unstratified log-rank P < .001). Median PFS was 3.4 months with chemotherapy alone versus 6.7 months with bevacizumab-containing therapy. RECIST ORR was 11.8% versus 27.3%, respectively (P = .001). The OS HR was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.66 to 1.08; P < .174; median OS, 13.3 v 16.6 months, respectively). Grade \xe2\x89\xa5 2 hypertension and proteinuria were more common with bevacizumab.

S'Pericytes are crucial for angiogenesis. The impact of pericyte function to bevacizumab efficacy in mCRC treatment has not been comprehensively examined. This retrospective study investigated germline polymorphisms in genes related to early pericyte maturation to predict bevacizumab efficacy in 424 patients of two clinical trials treated first line with FOLFIRI+bevacizumab. Eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested for potential biomarker value: RGS5 (regulator of G-protein signaling 5; rs1056515, rs2661280), PDGFR-\xce\xb2 (platelet-derived growth factor receptor-\xce\xb2; rs2229562, rs2302273), CSPG4 (chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan NG2; rs8023621, rs1127648) and RALBP1 (RalA binding protein 1; rs10989, rs329007). For progression-free survival (PFS), PDGFR-\xce\xb2 (rs2302273) was able to define significantly different patient cohorts in uni- and multivariate testing. RALPB1 (rs329007) showed predictive value for tumor response. The C allele in RGS5 (rs2661280) predicted longer overall survival and CSPG4 rs1127648 was associated with differences in PFS, but for both value was lost when multivariate analysis was applied. A comprehensive statistical analysis revealed that the biomarker value of the SNPs was dependent on primary tumor location. This is the first study to identify pericyte germline polymorphisms associated with clinical outcome in mCRC patients treated first line with FOLFIRI+bevacizumab. The differences seen with regard to primary tumor location may lead to further research to understand the clinical outcome differences seen in right- and left-sided colon cancer. '

Patients received pazopanib 800 mg orally daily and were evaluated for response after 8 weeks of treatment. Responses were measured using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.0, and confirmed with repeated scans after 8 weeks. Patients with objective response or stable disease continued treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred.RESULTS:  Fifteen of 55 patients (27%) had objective response to pazopanib. An additional 27 patients (49%) had stable disease, for a disease control rate of 76%. After a median follow-up of 16.7 months, the median progression-free survival for the entire group was 7.5 months (95% confidence interval, 5.4-9.4 months). Similar progression-free survival was observed regardless of whether previous treatment was with sunitinib or bevacizumab. The estimated overall survival rate for the entire group at 24 months was 43%.: "" Pazopanib is an active agent for the treatment of advanced clear cell renal carcinoma, even after failure of sunitinib or bevacizumab.

S' Based on the clinical data, bevacizumab has been approved in Australia and globally for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer. However, limited evidence exists for its cost-effectiveness. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of adding bevacizumab to capecitabine monotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, using data from the prospective economic evaluation conducted alongside the MAX trial.METHODS:  Individual patient level data on resource use and progression free survival were prospectively collected in the phase III MAX trial. Resource use data were collected for the period between randomisation and disease progression, and unit costs were assigned from the perspective of the Australian health care funder. Effectiveness was measured in quality adjusted progression free survival years, with utility scores obtained from both the community valued EQ-5D questionnaire and the patient valued UBQ-C questionnaire. Progression free survival was used as a secondary effectiveness measure.RESULTS:  The addition of bevacizumab to capecitabine monotherapy cost approximately $192,156 (95% confidence interval [CI], $135,619 to $326,894) per quality adjusted progression free survival year gained when using publicly listed pharmaceutical prices and utility values from the EQ-5D questionnaire. This decreased to $149,455 (95% CI, $100,356 to $245,910) when values from the UBQ-C questionnaire were applied.

S'Studies assessing the effect of bevacizumab (BEV) on breast cancer (BC) outcome have shown different effects on progression-free and overall survival, suggesting that a subgroup of patients may benefit from this treatment. Unfortunately, no biomarkers exist to identify these patients. Here, we investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VEGF pathway genes correlate with pathological complete response (pCR) in the neoadjuvant GeparQuinto trial. HER2-negative patients were randomized into treatment arms receiving either BEV combined with standard chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone. In a pre-planned biomarker study, DNA was collected from 729 and 724 patients, respectively from both treatment arms, and genotyped for 125 SNPs. Logistic regression assessed interaction between individual SNPs and both treatment arms to predict pCR. Five SNPs may be associated with a better response to BEV, but none of them remained significant after correction for multiple testing. The two SNPs most strongly associated, rs833058 and rs699947, were located upstream of the VEGF-A promoter. Odds ratios for the homozygous common, heterozygous and homozygous rare rs833058 genotypes were 2.36 (95% CI, 1.49-3.75), 1.20 (95% CI, 0.88-1.64) and 0.61 (95% CI, 0.34-1.12). Notably, some SNPs in VEGF-A exhibited a more pronounced effect in the triple-negative subgroup. Several SNPs in VEGF-A may be associated with improved pCR when receiving BEV in the neoadjuvant setting. Although none of the observed effects survived correction for multiple testing, our observations are consistent with previous studies on BEV efficacy in BC. Further research is warranted to clarify the predictive value of these markers. '

Bevacizumab combined with irinotecan produces impressive response rates in recurrent GBM. In a randomized phase II study, we investigated the efficacy of neoadjuvant bevacizumab combined with irinotecan (Bev-Iri) versus bevacizumab combined with temozolomide (Bev-Tem) before, during and after radiotherapy in newly diagnosed GBM.MATERIAL AND METHODS: "MATERIAL AND METHODS" After surgery, patients were randomized to Bev-Iri or Bev-Tem for eight weeks, followed by standard radiotherapy (60 Gy/30 fractions) and concomitant Bev-Iri or Bev-Tem followed by adjuvant Bev-Iri or Bev-Tem for another eight weeks. Bev-Iri: Bevacizumab and irinotecan were given every 14 days before, during and after radiotherapy. Bev-Tem: Bevacizumab was given as in Bev-Iri and temozolomide was given for five days every four weeks before and after radiotherapy and once daily during radiotherapy. The primary endpoint was response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and a pre-specified response rate of 30% or more was considered of interest for future studies. Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and toxicity.RESULTS:  The response rate was 32% (95% CI 17-51%) for Bev-Tem (n = 32) and 23% (95% CI 9-44%) for Bev-Iri (n = 31) (p = 0.56). Median PFS was 7.7 and 7.3 months for Bev-Tem and Bev-Iri, respectively. Hematological toxicity was more frequent with Bev-Tem including one death from febrile neutropenia whereas non-hematological toxicity was manageable.S:  Only the Bev-Tem arm met the pre-specified level of activity of interest.

Preliminary antitumour activity of dacarbazine plus bevacizumab is evaluated, together with the toxicity and safety profile, in MM patients. This prospective, open-label, phase II study included patients with previously untreated MM or unresectable melanoma. Patients received dacarbazine and bevacizumab until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. The primary efficacy variable was the overall response rate. The secondary efficacy parameters included duration of response, duration of stable disease, time to progression/progression-free survival, time to treatment failure and overall survival. The safety analysis included recordings of adverse events and exposure to study treatment. The intention-to-treat population included 37 patients (24 men and 13 women, mean age 54.2\xc2\xb113.1 years). Overall response rate was 18.9% (seven patients achieved a response) and clinical benefit was 48.6%. In patients who achieved a response, the median duration of response was 16.9 months and the median duration of stable disease was 12.5 months. The median time to progression/progression-free survival and time to treatment failure were 5.5 and 3.1 months, respectively. The median overall survival was 11.4 months. Almost all patients (94.6%) experienced at least one adverse event; however, no new area of toxicity of bevacizumab emerged. The dacarbazine/bevacizumab combination provides benefits compared with dacarbazine monotherapy in historical controls, with an acceptable safety profile.

IOP at 1 year postoperatively was significantly lower than baseline (placebo: 25.6\xc2\xb19.9 mm Hg vs 11.5\xc2\xb13.9 mm Hg, p<0.01; bevacizumab: 24.8\xc2\xb18.1 mm Hg vs 11.9\xc2\xb13.8 mm Hg, p<0.01), with no difference between treatment groups (p=0.69). However, absolute success was higher in the bevacizumab group (71% vs 51%, p=0.02), with the need for IOP-lowering interventions (needlings) being lower in this group (12% vs 33%, p=0.003). Complication rates were low and comparable between groups.S:  Peroperative administration of intracameral bevacizumab significantly reduces the need for additional interventions during the follow-up of patients undergoing trabeculectomy.'

S' We evaluated the effect of intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA) or intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) on subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) in eyes with diabetic macular edema (DME).METHODS:  In this prospective, randomized, interventional comparative study, 51 DME eyes of 51 patients were randomized to receive either IVTA or IVB. The central macular thickness (CMT) and SFCT were determined by optical coherence tomography at 24 hours, 7 days, and 4, 8, and 12 weeks. The SFCT at 1500 and 3000 \xce\xbcm nasal or temporal to the central fovea also was measured. The values obtained before were compared to those obtained 12 weeks after the injections.RESULTS:  The eyes were randomly assigned to the IVTA (25 eyes) and IVB (26 eyes) groups. The SFCT was reduced significantly in the IVTA group from 24 hours to 12 weeks. The average \xc2\xb1 SD of the SFCT expressed as the ratio to baseline thickness decreased to 94.8% \xc2\xb1 5.6% (P < 0.01) at 24 hours after IVTA and remained unchanged up to 12 weeks (91.8% \xc2\xb1 10.5%, P < 0.01, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). In the IVB group, no significant difference was found in the SFCT after IVB for 12 weeks. The CMT decreased significantly in both groups from 24 hours to 4 weeks; however, the decrease was not significant at 8 weeks or later in the IVB group.S:  The decrease in choroidal thickness in eyes with DME after IVTA suggests that the choroidal pathology in diabetic retinopathy might be due to steroid-sensitive factors rather than vascular endothelial growth factor.

S' This first-in-human study evaluated the safety, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of onartuzumab, a monovalent antibody against the receptor tyrosine kinase MET.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN" This 3+3 dose-escalation study comprised three stages: (i) phase Ia dose escalation of onartuzumab at doses of 1, 4, 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks; (ii) phase Ia cohort expansion at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of 15 mg/kg; and (iii) phase Ib dose escalation of onartuzumab at 10 and 15 mg/kg in combination with bevacizumab (15 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks). Serum samples were collected for evaluation of pharmacokinetics, potential pharmacodynamic markers, and antitherapeutic antibodies.RESULTS:  Thirty-four patients with solid tumors were treated in phase Ia and 9 in phase Ib. Onartuzumab was generally well tolerated at all dose levels evaluated; the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. The most frequent drug-related adverse events included fatigue, peripheral edema, nausea, and hypoalbuminemia. In the phase Ib cohort, onartuzumab at the RP2D was combined with bevacizumab and no dose-limiting toxicities were seen. Onartuzumab showed linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range from 4 to 30 mg/kg. The half-life was approximately 8 to 12 days. There were no apparent pharmacokinetic interactions between onartuzumab and bevacizumab, and antitherapeutic antibodies did not seem to affect the safety or pharmacokinetics of onartuzumab. A patient with gastric carcinoma in the 20-mg/kg dose cohort achieved a durable complete response for nearly 2 years.S:  Onartuzumab was generally well tolerated as a single agent and in combination with bevacizumab in patients with solid tumors.'

S' The dose of bevacizumab necessary to optimally inhibit tumor angiogenesis in advanced renal cell carcinoma is unknown. In this phase II trial, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of 2 escalated doses of bevacizumab in patients with advanced clear cell renal carcinoma.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Eligible patients had metastatic or locally advanced unresectable clear cell renal carcinoma. Patients who were previously untreated or who had previously received vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-targeted therapy were eligible and were considered separately in the efficacy evaluation. Two doses of bevacizumab were evaluated in sequential cohorts: 15 mg/kg every 2 weeks and 15 mg/kg weekly. The initial reevaluation was at 8 weeks; responding and stable patients continued treatment, with reevaluations every 8 weeks until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred.RESULTS:  One hundred nineteen eligible patients were enrolled and received bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every 2 weeks (n = 61) or bevacizumab 15 mg/kg weekly (n = 58). Seventy patients were previously untreated with VEGFR-targeted therapy. In previously untreated patients, the overall response rate was 19%, with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 7.8 months. Less activity was seen in patients previously treated with VEGFR-targeted agents (overall response rate, 4%; median PFS, 3.7 months). There was no suggestion of any difference in efficacy between the 2 dose levels tested. Both dose levels were tolerated well by most patients, with a spectrum of toxicity typical for bevacizumab. Grade 3/4 proteinuria was more frequent with both of these escalated doses, particularly with 15 mg/kg weekly.: "" Although administration of escalated doses of bevacizumab was feasible in patients with advanced clear cell renal carcinoma, there was no suggestion that these doses were more efficacious than bevacizumab administered at the standard dose of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks.'

Patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) after biopsy or resection were enrolled on a clinical trial with hypo-IMRT and TMZ (hypo-IMRT/TMZ alone) from 2008 to 2010, or in the second protocol with the same hypo-IMRT and TMZ plus BEV (hypo-IMRT/TMZ/BEV) from 2010 to 2013. All patients received postoperative hypo-IMRT to the surgical cavity and residual tumor plus margin to a total dose of 60 Gy and to the T2 abnormality with margin to 30 Gy, both in ten fractions. Concurrent TMZ (75 mg/m(2)/day) was given to all patients for 28 consecutive days followed by adjuvant TMZ (150-200 mg/m(2)/day). Patients enrolled on the hypo-IMRT/TMZ/BEV trial received concurrent and adjuvant BEV (10 mg/kg) on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle.

S' The definition of a best maintenance strategy following combination chemotherapy plus bevacizumab in metastatic colorectal cancer is unclear. We investigated whether no continuation of therapy or bevacizumab alone are non-inferior to fluoropyrimidine plus bevacizumab, following induction treatment with a fluoropyrimidine plus oxaliplatin plus bevacizumab.METHODS: In this open-label, non-inferiority, randomised phase 3 trial, we included patients aged 18 years or older with histologically confirmed, previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2, adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function, no pre-existing neuropathy greater than grade 1, and measurable disease, from 55 hospitals and 51 private practices in Germany. After 24 weeks of induction therapy with either fluorouracil plus leucovorin plus oxaliplatin or capecitabine plus oxaliplatin, both with bevacizumab, patients without disease progression were randomly assigned centrally by fax (1:1:1) to standard maintenance treatment with a fluoropyrimidine plus bevacizumab, bevacizumab alone, or no treatment. Both patients and investigators were aware of treatment assignment. Stratification criteria were response status, termination of oxaliplatin, previous adjuvant treatment with oxaliplatin, and ECOG performance status. At first progression, re-induction with all drugs of the induction treatment was a planned part of the protocol. Time to failure of strategy was the primary endpoint, defined as time from randomisation to second progression after maintenance (and if applicable re-induction), death, or initiation of further treatment including a new drug. Time to failure of strategy was equivalent to time to first progression for patients who did not receive re-induction (for any reason).

Median time to failure of strategy was 6\xc2\xb79 months (95% CI 6\xc2\xb71-8\xc2\xb75) for the fluoropyrimidine plus bevacizumab group, 6\xc2\xb71 months (5\xc2\xb73-7\xc2\xb74) for the bevacizumab alone group, and 6\xc2\xb74 months (4\xc2\xb78-7\xc2\xb76) for the no treatment group. Bevacizumab alone was non-inferior to standard fluoropyrimidine plus bevacizumab (hazard ratio [HR] 1\xc2\xb708 [95% CI 0\xc2\xb785-1\xc2\xb737]; p=0\xc2\xb753; upper limit of the one-sided 99\xc2\xb78% CI 1\xc2\xb742), whereas no treatment was not (HR 1\xc2\xb726 [0\xc2\xb799-1\xc2\xb760]; p=0\xc2\xb7056; upper limit of the one-sided 99\xc2\xb78% CI 1\xc2\xb765). The protocol-defined re-induction after first progression was rarely done (30 [19%] patients in the fluoropyrimidine plus bevacizumab group, 67 [43%] in the bevacizumab monotherapy group, and 73 [46%] in the no treatment group. The most common grade 3 adverse event was sensory neuropathy (21 [13%] of 158 patients in the fluoropyrimidine plus bevacizumab group, 22 [14%] of 156 patients in the bevacizumab alone group, and 12 [8%] of 158 patients in the no treatment group).INTERPRETATION: "INTERPRETATION" Although non-inferiority for bevacizumab alone was demonstrated for the primary endpoint, maintenance treatment with a fluoropyrimidine plus bevacizumab may be the preferable option for patients following an induction treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab, as it allows the planned discontinuation of the initial combination without compromising time with controlled disease. Only a few patients were exposed to re-induction treatment, thus deeming the primary endpoint time to failure of strategy non-informative and clinically irrelevant. Progression-free survival and overall survival should be considered primary endpoints in future trials exploring maintenance strategies.'

S'"BACKGROUND/AIMS" Bevacizumab (Avastin), an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor drug, has been successfully used in recent years to treat ocular pathologies, mostly by intravitreal administration. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of topically applied bevacizumab for the treatment of neovascular glaucoma (NVG).METHODS:  Patients with NVG were treated with topical bevacizumab (25 mg/ml) 4 times daily during 2 weeks. The following parameters were evaluated at baseline and on days 3, 7 and 14: visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, intraocular pressure (IOP), heart rate and systemic blood pressure. Iris neovascularization was documented using slit-lamp color photos at baseline and on day 14.RESULTS:  Eight eyes of 8 patients with NVG were evaluated. After the 2-week treatment, mean IOP was lowered from 34.9 mm Hg (SD 12.8) at baseline to 28.8 mm Hg (SD 9.9) on day 14, representing a mean reduction of 6.1 mm Hg (17.5%). Three patients had clinical regression of their iris neovascularization. Ocular adverse events were transient and included mild upper eyelid swelling, mild exacerbation of superficial punctate keratitis and mild corneal epithelial bullae in an already edematous cornea. There were no serious systemic adverse events.S:  Topical application of bevacizumab may lower IOP and result in regression of neovascularization in patients with NVG.'

S'"INTRODUCTION" Bevacizumab improves survival in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This phase II clinical trial assessed the effects of the addition of bevacizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in resectable nonsquamous NSCLC.METHODS:  Patients with resectable stage IB-IIIA nonsquamous NSCLC were treated with bevacizumab followed by imaging 2 weeks later to assess single-agent effect. After this they received two cycles of bevacizumab with four cycles of cisplatin and docetaxel followed by surgical resection. Resected patients were eligible for adjuvant bevacizumab. The primary endpoint was the rate of pathological downstaging (decrease from pretreatment clinical stage to post-treatment pathological stage). Secondary endpoints included overall survival, safety, and radiologic response.RESULTS:  Fifty patients were enrolled. Thirty-four (68%) were clinical stage IIIA. All three doses of neoadjuvant bevacizumab were delivered to 40 of 50 patients. Six patients (12%) discontinued because of bevacizumab-related adverse events. The rate of downstaging (38%), response to chemotherapy (45%), and perioperative complications (12%) were comparable with historical data. No partial responses were observed to single-agent bevacizumab, but 18% of the patients developed new intratumoral cavitation, with a trend toward improved pathologic response (57% versus 21%; p = 0.07). A major pathologic response (\xe2\x89\xa590% treatment effect) was associated with survival at 3 years (100% versus 49%; p = 0.01). No patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLC (0 of 10) had a pathologic response as compared with 11 of 31 with wild-type KRAS.: "" Although preoperative bevacizumab plus chemotherapy was feasible, it did not improve downstaging in unselected patients. New cavitation after single-agent bevacizumab is a potential biomarker. Alternative strategies are needed for KRAS-mutant tumors.'

S' The relative efficacy and safety of intravitreous aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab in the treatment of diabetic macular edema are unknown.METHODS:  At 89 clinical sites, we randomly assigned 660 adults (mean age, 61\xc2\xb110 years) with diabetic macular edema involving the macular center to receive intravitreous aflibercept at a dose of 2.0 mg (224 participants), bevacizumab at a dose of 1.25 mg (218 participants), or ranibizumab at a dose of 0.3 mg (218 participants). The study drugs were administered as often as every 4 weeks, according to a protocol-specified algorithm. The primary outcome was the mean change in visual acuity at 1 year.RESULTS:  From baseline to 1 year, the mean visual-acuity letter score (range, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better visual acuity; a score of 85 is approximately 20/20) improved by 13.3 with aflibercept, by 9.7 with bevacizumab, and by 11.2 with ranibizumab. Although the improvement was greater with aflibercept than with the other two drugs (P<0.001 for aflibercept vs. bevacizumab and P=0.03 for aflibercept vs. ranibizumab), it was not clinically meaningful, because the difference was driven by the eyes with worse visual acuity at baseline (P<0.001 for interaction). When the initial visual-acuity letter score was 78 to 69 (equivalent to approximately 20/32 to 20/40) (51% of participants), the mean improvement was 8.0 with aflibercept, 7.5 with bevacizumab, and 8.3 with ranibizumab (P>0.50 for each pairwise comparison). When the initial letter score was less than 69 (approximately 20/50 or worse), the mean improvement was 18.9 with aflibercept, 11.8 with bevacizumab, and 14.2 with ranibizumab (P<0.001 for aflibercept vs. bevacizumab, P=0.003 for aflibercept vs. ranibizumab, and P=0.21 for ranibizumab vs. bevacizumab). There were no significant differences among the study groups in the rates of serious adverse events (P=0.40), hospitalization (P=0.51), death (P=0.72), or major cardiovascular events (P=0.56).'

S' The current study was conducted to evaluate the safety and biological activity of dual inhibition of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway with combined bevacizumab and cediranib (a VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor).METHODS:  This was a 3 + 3 dose escalation study in patients with advanced solid tumors. Cediranib was given orally daily for 21 days and bevacizumab intravenously every 2 weeks. Pharmacokinetics and correlates (nitric oxide synthase, nitrate oxide, and circulating tumor cells) were assessed.RESULTS:  Fifty-one patients were treated. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) (grade 3-4; graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events [version 3.0]) observed included 1 patient with chest pain, 1 patient with fatigue, 2 patients with thrombocytopenia, 3 patients with hypertension (1 with intracranial hemorrhage), and 1 patient with grade 5 hemoptysis. Moreover, 2 patients presented with grade 3 intracranial bleeding beyond the DLT window. Dose level 2 (cediranib at a dose of 20 mg/day and bevacizumab at a dose of 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks) was selected as the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D); 17 patients were treated at dose level 2 with 1 DLT and no intracranial bleeding or severe hypertension reported. Pharmacokinetics of cediranib at dose level 3 demonstrated a 46% to 77% increase in area under the curve (0-24 hours) on cycle 1 day 1 compared with historical controls. Four patients attained partial remissions: inflammatory breast cancer (-54%), basal cell carcinoma (-33%), alveolar soft part sarcoma (-33%), and synovial sarcoma (-32%). Patients with a lower circulating tumor cell count (< 30) at the predose period had a longer time to tumor progression (P = .024, log-rank test).S:  Cediranib at a dose of 20 mg/day and bevacizumab at a dose of 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks was found to be the RP2D. Activity in several tumor types was noted. Central nervous system bleeding and severe hypertension were observed at doses above the RP2D.'

S' According to recent studies, the newest strategy for the treatment of exudative age-related macular degeneration is to combine anti-VEGF agents with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as nepafenac and bromfenac to decrease the frequency of intravitreal injections. Since most research has focused on ranibizumab, the aim of this study is to evaluate whether an alternative drug such as bevacizumab could lead to similar outcomes.MATERIAL AND METHODS: "MATERIAL AND METHODS" The study was conducted on a group of 26 patients who were administered intravitreal bevacizumab and topical bromfenac (study group) and 26 patients with single bevacizumab therapy (control group). Cases that were not qualified for ranibizumab therapy were included in the study group.RESULTS:  The study revealed that the visual acuity and parameters observed in OCT improved more in the study group than in the control group. However, the correlations between the above factors and the frequency of intravitreal injections were statistically significant only in visual acuity.S:  We recommend the combined therapy of bevacizumab and bromfenac as an alternative and beneficial method of treatment in patients with exudative AMD who do not qualify for ranibizumab therapy. This combined therapy might efficiently reduce the number of intravitreal injections of bevacizumab.'

S'A combination of monoclonal antibody that binds and inhibits effects induced by vascular endothelial growth factor and tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor represents a promising concept to block pathological angiogenesis completely. A phase I study combining daily oral pazopanib and bevacizumab (given iv every 2 weeks) was performed in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose of the two drugs in combination. Pazopanib pharmacokinetics were evaluated to compare pharmacokinetic parameters given alone and those observed on the day of the bevacizumab administration. Plasma pazopanib concentrations were obtained in 25 patients treated at two dose levels (400 or 600 mg) at Day 1 (given alone) and Day 15 (the day of the 7.5 mg/kg bevacizumab infusion), and analyzed using the NONMEM program. The apparent oral clearance (CL/F, mean value of 0.60 L/h) presented an inter-individual variability of 40 %, and an inter-occasion of 27 %. A modest but statistically significant decrease in CL/F was observed from Day 1 to Day 15 (-16.4, 95 % confidence interval of -8.5 to -27.2 %). However, trough pazopanib concentrations observed at Day 16 (24 h after the bevacizumab iv infusion) were not significantly higher than those observed just before the beginning of the bevacizumab iv infusion, suggesting that the pharmacokinetic change between Day 1 and Day 15 was not due to an interaction of bevacizumab. Overall, the mean observed concentrations at the maximum tolerated pazopanib dose (600 mg) at both Day 1 and Day 15 were higher than those observed at 800 mg once daily level (corresponding to the recommended dose when given alone) during the first-in-man phase 1 study of pazopanib in monochemotherapy. This first population pharmacokinetic analysis of pazopanib shows that inter-individual and inter-study pharmacokinetic variability emphasize the need for further evaluation of therapeutic drug monitoring for pazopanib as suggested for other tyrosine kinase inhibitors.'

S'"INTRODUCTION" PRONOUNCE compared the efficacy and safety of pemetrexed+carboplatin followed by pemetrexed (Pem+Cb) with paclitaxel+carboplatin+bevacizumab followed by bevacizumab (Pac+Cb+Bev) in patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).METHODS:  Patients \xe2\x89\xa518 years of age with stage IV nonsquamous NSCLC (American Joint Committee on Cancer v7.0), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0/1 were randomized (1:1) to four cycles of induction Pem+Cb (pemetrexed, 500 mg/m, carboplatin, area under the curve = 6) followed by Pem maintenance or Pac+Cb+Bev (paclitaxel, 200 mg/m, carboplatin, area under the curve = 6, and bevacizumab, 15 mg/kg) followed by Bev maintenance in the absence of progressive disease or discontinuation. The primary objective was progression-free survival (PFS) without grade 4 toxicity (G4PFS). Secondary end points were PFS, overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and safety. Resource utilization was also assessed.RESULTS:  Baseline characteristics of the patients randomized to Pem+Cb (N = 182) and Pac+Cb+Bev (N = 179) were well balanced between the arms. Median (months) G4PFS was 3.91 for Pem+Cb and 2.86 for Pac+Cb+Bev (hazard ratio = 0.85, 90% confidence interval, 0.7-1.04; p = 0.176); PFS, OS, ORR, or DCR did not differ significantly between the arms. Significantly more drug-related grade 3/4 anemia (18.7% versus 5.4%) and thrombocytopenia (24.0% versus 9.6%) were reported for Pem+Cb. Significantly more grade 3/4 neutropenia (48.8% versus 24.6%), grade 1/2 alopecia (28.3% versus 8.2%), and grade 1/2 sensory neuropathy were reported for Pac+Cb+Bev. Number of hospitalizations and overall length of stay did not differ significantly between the arms.S:  Pem+Cb did not produce significantly better G4PFS compared with Pac+Cb+Bev. Pem+Cb was not superior in PFS, OS, ORR, or DCR compared with Pac+Cb+Bev. Both regimens were well tolerated, although, toxicity profiles differed.'

S' To compare the effects of subthreshold grid laser treatment (SGLT) and intravitreal bevacizumab injection (IVBI) for the treatment of macular edema (ME) secondary to branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) recurring after conventional grid laser photocoagulation.METHODS:  Thirty-five eyes were considered in this prospective, randomised, interventional study and treated with micropulse diode laser (SGLT subgroup) or IVBI (IVBI subgroup). SGLT was administered once, whereas IVBI (1.25 mg) was given at baseline and then on a pro re nata regimen according to ME presence on optical coherence tomography (OCT), performed at monthly examinations over a 12-month follow-up. Primary outcome measures were the mean BCVA changes over the follow-up and the decrease in mean central foveal thickness (CFT) on optical coherence tomography (OCT). Secondary outcomes included the proportion of eyes that gained at least 15 letters (approximately three lines) at the 12-month examination.RESULTS:  Eighteen and 17 patients were assigned to SGLT and IVBI subgroups, respectively. At baseline, the subgroups were similar with regard to mean ME duration, BCVA, and CFT. At month 12, mean CFT significantly improved from 484 \xce\xbcm to 271 \xce\xbcm in the IVBI subgroup, whereas it was unchanged in the SGLT subgroup. Mean BCVA changed from 0.92\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.3 (LogMAR) to 0.99\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.2 in the SGLT subgroup; in the IVBI subgroup, mean BCVA showed a statistically significant improvement from 0.94\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.3 to 0.72\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.2. Ten patients in the IVBI subgroup (58 %) and no patient in the SGLT subgroup gained at least three lines.: "" At the 1-year follow-up, IVBI provided a significant functional and anatomical improvement, whereas SGLT failed to demonstrate any beneficial effects. IVBI might be a useful approach in the treatment of recurrent ME secondary to BRVO already treated with conventional grid laser photocoagulation.

S'Bendamustine, a cytotoxic alkylating agent, has shown promising results in solid tumors. An investigator-initiated phase I clinical trial of the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agent bevacizumab and bendamustine was conducted in patients with advanced cancer, because the 2 drugs have different mechanisms of antitumor activity and nonoverlapping toxicity. Patients were treated with escalating doses of intravenous bendamustine (70, 80, 90, and 100 mg/m(2); days 1 and 2) and intravenous bevacizumab (10 mg/kg; days 1 and 15). A conventional "3 + 3" study design was used. Forty-two patients were treated: 23 women and 19 men. The median age was 60 years. Patients had received a median of 4 prior therapies (range, 1-10). The most common cancer types were colorectal (n=9), head and neck (n= 8), non-small cell lung (n=6), and breast (n=5). Overall, 117 cycles were administered (median per patient, 2; range, 1-8). No dose-limiting toxicities were noted during the escalation phase. Therefore, the highest dose (level 4) of bendamustine (100 mg/m(2)) was used in the expansion phase. The most common toxicities were fatigue (n=22), nausea (n=14), anorexia (n=9), and thrombocytopenia (n=7). Of 38 patients who were evaluable for response, 23 (61%) had stable disease, including 2 (5.2%) who had stable disease for 6 months or more (1 with adenoid cystic carcinoma and 1 with non-small cell lung cancer). This regimen of bendamustine (100 mg/m(2)) and bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) was well tolerated and yielded disease stabilization in selected heavily pretreated patients with advanced cancer. '

S' Adding leucovorin to fluorouracil is known to improve response rate and overall survival in first-line chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The present multicenter phase II study evaluated the efficacy and safety of S-1, oxaliplatin, oral leucovorin, and bevacizumab combination therapy (SOLA).METHODS:  Patients with unresectable and untreated mCRC received S-1 (40-60 mg bid) plus leucovorin (25 mg bid) orally for 1 week, and oxaliplatin (85 mg/m(2)) and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) intravenously on day 1, every 2 weeks. Efficacy endpoints, including the response rate (the primary endpoint) and progression-free survival, were assessed by an independent review committee.RESULTS:  Of the 29 eligible patients, 25 patients (86%) had a partial response [95% confidence interval (CI) 68-96%] and the remaining four patients showed stable disease with a trend toward tumor shrinkage. The median progression-free survival was 15 months (95% CI 10-26 months). The median overall survival was not reached after a median follow-up time of 34 months. The 3-year survival rate was 54%. Curative resections of metastatic lesions were performed in eight patients (28%). Common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (20%), hypertension (23%), anorexia (20%), fatigue (17%), diarrhea (10%), and peripheral sensory neuropathy (53%).S:  The SOLA therapy showed excellent efficacy and tolerable toxicities except for peripheral sensory neuropathy in patients with mCRC. Since oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy can be alleviated by modifying its administration, SOLA is a promising candidate regimen to be compared with FOLFOX plus bevacizumab in a future phase III trial.CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: "CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER" JapicCTI-090881.'

S' Bevacizumab is associated with decreased vascular permeability that allows for more aggressive radiotherapy schedules. We conducted a phase II trial in newly diagnosed glioblastoma utilizing a novel hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HFSRT) schedule combined with temozolomide and bevacizumab.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN" Patients with tumor volume \xe2\x89\xa460 cc were treated with HFSRT (6 \xc3\x97 6 Gy to contrast enhancement and 6 \xc3\x97 4 Gy to FLAIR hyperintensity with dose painting) combined with concomitant/adjuvant temozolomide and bevacizumab at standard doses. Primary endpoint was 1-year overall survival (OS): promising = 70%; nonpromising = 50%; \xce\xb1 = 0.1; \xce\xb2 = 0.1.RESULTS:  Forty patients were enrolled (median age: 55 years; methylated MGMT promoter: 23%; unmethylated: 70%). The 1-year OS was 93% [95% confidence interval (CI), 84-100] and median OS was 19 months. The median PFS was 10 months, with no pseudo-progression observed. The objective response rate (ORR) was 57%. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas glioblastoma transcriptional subclasses (Nanostring assay) suggested patients with a proneural phenotype (26%) fared worse (ORR = 14%, vs. 77% for other subclasses; P = 0.009). Dynamic susceptibility-contrast perfusion MRI showed marked decreases in relative cerebral blood volume over time (P < 0.0001) but had no prognostic value, whereas higher baseline apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) ratios and persistent hypermetabolism at the 6-month FDG-PET predicted poor OS (P = 0.05 and 0.0001, respectively). Quality-of-life (FACT-BR-4) and neuropsychological test scores were stable over time, although some domains displayed transient decreases following HFSRT.S:  This aggressive radiotherapy schedule was safe and more convenient for patients, achieving an OS that is comparable with historical controls. Analysis of advanced neuroimaging parameters suggests ADC and FDG-PET as potentially useful biomarkers, whereas tissue correlatives uncovered the poor prognosis associated with the proneural signature in non-IDH-1-mutated glioblastoma.'

S"Neoadjuvant therapy (NAC) is commonly used in operable breast cancer. Previous studies have suggested a high rate of postoperative complications after NAC. We prospectively evaluated the surgical complications in a cohort of patients who underwent mastectomy following neoadjuvant adriamycin/cytoxan/taxol (AC/T) plus bevacizumab (bev) and compared the rate of complications to a matched cohort of neoadjuvant AC/T without bev. One hundred patients with HER2-negative breast cancer enrolled in a single-arm trial of neoadjuvant AC/T plus bev (cohort 1), 60 of these patients underwent mastectomy and were matched with 59 patients who received standard neoadjuvant AC/T (cohort 2) over a similar time period in the same healthcare system. All patients underwent mastectomy with or without reconstruction. Fisher's exact tests were used to compare complication rates, with p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05 considered significant. Patients were matched well in terms of demographics. The overall complication rate was 32\xc2\xa0% in cohort 1 and 31\xc2\xa0% in cohort 2 (p value\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa01, Table\xc2\xa01). In cohort 1, 7 of 23 (30\xc2\xa0%) patients who underwent immediate expander/implant reconstruction had complications, including 2 patients who had explantation of their reconstructions. In cohort 2, 0 of 8 (0\xc2\xa0%) had complications (p value\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.15). Nearly a third of patients undergoing NAC with AC/T with or without bev developed a postoperative complication after mastectomy. The use of bev was not associated with a significant increase in surgical complications, although this is a nonrandomized data set with a small sample size. As larger data sets become available with the use of neoadjuvant bevacizumab with mastectomy, further refinement may be necessary. "

S' This study investigated the predictive value of circulating microRNA-126 (cir-miRNA-126) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) treated with first-line chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab.METHODS:  The study included 68 patients. Blood samples (plasma) were collected before the treatment initiation, at the first clinical evaluation after 3 weeks and at progression. Levels of cir-miRNA-126 were determined by qRT-PCR after purification of total RNA from plasma. Primary clinical end points were response rates evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) and progression-free survival (PFS).RESULTS:  Changes in circulating miRNA-126 during treatment were predictive of tumour response. Non-responding patients had a median increase in cir-miRNA-126 of 0.244 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.050-0.565) compared with a median decrease of -0.374 (95% CI, -0.472 to -0.111) in the responding patients, P=0.002. A significant positive correlation was demonstrated by comparing the changes in tumour size with the changes in cir-miRNA-126, r=0.48, P=0.0001. Grouping the patients according to the changes in cir-miRNA-126 disclosed a borderline significant separation of the groups in the PFS analysis favouring patients with decreasing miRNA-126 levels, hazard ratio (HR) 0.60 (95% CI, 0.33-1.09), P=0.07.S:  The present results indicate that changes in cir-miRNA-126 during treatment are related to the response to chemotherapy and bevacizumab in patients with mCRC, thus representing a possible biomarker for the resistance to anti-angiogenic containing treatments.'

S' Docetaxel monotherapy is one of the standard treatments for non-small-cell lung cancer in elderly patients. The addition of bevacizumab to docetaxel seems promising; however, the feasibility of this combination has not been investigated in such patients.METHODS:  Patients with advanced non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer aged 70 years or older who had not previously received cytotoxic chemotherapy were enrolled. Patients in the Level 0 cohort received docetaxel 60 mg/m(2) and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg, whereas those in the Level-1 cohort received docetaxel 50 mg/m(2) and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg. Chemotherapy was repeated 3 weekly for six cycles. The primary endpoint was toxicity and the secondary endpoints were response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, and proportion of patients who underwent three or more cycles of chemotherapy.RESULTS:  Twenty-one patients were enrolled from December 2010 to September 2012 at six institutes. Of the nine patients enrolled in Level 0, two experienced dose-limiting toxicity (febrile neutropenia and prolonged Grade 4 neutropenia in one patient, and Grade 3 infection in another patient) during the first cycle. Enrollment to the Level 0 cohort was terminated because two patients developed Grade 4 sepsis during later cycles. The remaining 12 patients were enrolled in the Level-1 cohort, in which two dose-limiting toxicities (prolonged Grade 4 neutropenia and Grade 3 increased aminotransferase level) were observed. No patient in the Level-1 cohort experienced Grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity. Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 89 % of Level 0 patients and 50 % of Level-1 patients. The proportion of patients who experienced Grade 3/4 infection, febrile neutropenia or sepsis was 44 % in the Level 0 cohort, and 8 % in the Level-1 cohort. The overall response rate to chemotherapy and progression-free survival were 29 % (95 % CI, 11-52 %) and 5.9 months (95 % CI, 3.6-9.1 months), respectively. Efficacy outcomes did not differ significantly between the cohorts.S:  Toxicities were tolerable in level-1 cohort. The recommended dose of combination chemotherapy with docetaxel and bevacizumab for elderly patients was determined as 50 mg/m(2) of docetaxel and 15 mg/kg of bevacizumab and toxicities were tolerable.

The OPAL study examined the effect of BEV+FOLFOXIRI followed by 5FU/LV and BEV maintenance on progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with previously untreated unresectable mCRC.METHODS:  Eligible patients had histologically confirmed mCRC, ECOG performance status \xe2\xa9\xbd1 and were 18-70 years old. Patients received up to 12 cycles of FOLFOXIRI+BEV q2w (induction phase) followed by up to \xe2\xa9\xbd40 cycles of 5FU/LV+BEV q2w (maintenance phase). Median PFS was the primary end point; secondary end points included response, OS, secondary resection rate, safety and prognostic value of pharmacogenetic profiling.RESULTS:  Ninety-seven patients were enrolled. Of these, 90 received study medication and formed the safety population: 64 males; median age 58 (range 28-71) years; ECOG performance status 0/1 in 54%/46% patients; and liver only disease in 35 patients. Relative dose intensities were 79-85% for all four drugs. The incidence of adverse events (AEs) was as previously reported and there were no new safety signals. In total, 87 serious AEs occurred in 39 patients (43%). Median PFS was 11.1 months (95% CI 9.4-12.0) and did thus not meet the primary objective of 12 months. Median OS was 32.2 months (95% CI 22.6-36.9). Fifty-two patients were pharmacogenetically profiled.S:  FOLFOXIRI+BEV was feasible in this molecularly unselected mCRC patient population, showing a high efficacy in terms of survival, overall response and secondary resection rate. Pharmacogenomic profiling revealed no clinically relevant marker.'

S'"AIM" We investigated whether the type of antibody [bevacizumab (bev) or cetuximab (cet)] added to neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy before curative liver resection was associated with histological response, the pattern of tumor destruction and clinical outcome in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CLM).METHODS:  We investigated 138 patients with KRAS wild-type status (codon 12, 13 and 61) who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy including bev (n = 101) or cet (n = 37). The primary endpoint was histological response. Secondary endpoints were necrosis and fibrosis of metastases, radiological response, recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS).RESULTS:  Histological response was not significantly different between the two groups (P = 0.19). A significantly higher fraction of patients in the bev group showed necrosis of the metastases of \xe2\x89\xa5 50% (P < 0.001), while a higher fraction of patients in the cet group showed fibrosis of \xe2\x89\xa5 40% (P = 0.030). Radiological response was not significantly different (P = 0.17). Median RFS was significantly shorter in the cet group in univariable analysis (HR 1.59 (95% CI 1.00, 2.51), P = 0.049), but this difference did not remain significant in multivariable analysis (P = 0.45). The 3-year OS rate was not significantly different (P = 0.73).S:  The addition of bevacizumab to combination chemotherapy showed more necrosis but less fibrosis of metastases compared to cetuximab and a trend towards higher histological and radiological response and longer RFS. Further investigations of biological tumor characteristics are required to individualize treatment combinations.'

S' ML18147 evaluated continued bevacizumab with second-line chemotherapy for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) progressing after the standard first-line bevacizumab-containing therapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Evaluating outcomes according to tumor Kirsten rat sarcoma virus oncogene (KRAS) status was an exploratory analysis. KRAS data were collected from local laboratories (using their established methods) and/or from a central laboratory (mutation-specific Scorpion amplification-refractory mutation system). No adjustment was made for multiplicity; analyses were not powered to detect statistically significant differences.RESULTS:  Of 820 patients, 616 (75%) had unambiguous KRAS data; 316 (51%) had KRAS wild-type tumors and 300 (49%) had mutant KRAS tumors. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.4 months for bevacizumab plus chemotherapy and 4.5 months for chemotherapy [P < 0.0001; HR = 0.61; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.49-0.77] for wild-type KRAS and 5.5 and 4.1 months, respectively (P = 0.0027; HR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.56-0.89) for mutant KRAS. The median overall survival (OS) was 15.4 and 11.1 months, respectively (P = 0.0052; HR = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.53-0.90) for wild-type KRAS and 10.4 versus 10.0 months, respectively (P = 0.4969; HR = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.71-1.18) for mutant KRAS. In both analyses, no treatment interaction by KRAS status was observed (PFS, P = 0.4436; OS, P = 0.1266).S:  Bevacizumab beyond first progression represents an option for patients with mCRC treated with bevacizumab plus standard first-line chemotherapy, independent of KRAS status.'

S' Patients with biochemical disease recurrence (BCR) after definitive treatment for prostate cancer comprise a heterogeneous population for whom standard therapy options are lacking. The purpose of the current trial was to evaluate the feasibility, toxicity, and efficacy of early multimodality systemic therapy in men with BCR.METHODS:  Eligible patients had an increasing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, a PSA doubling time \xe2\x89\xa410 months, and no evidence of metastases after radical prostatectomy (RP) and/or radiotherapy (RT) for localized disease. Treatment consisted of docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, bevacizumab at a dose of 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 8 cycles, and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for 18 months. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients who were free from PSA progression 1 year after the completion of therapy.RESULTS:  A total of 41 patients were included in the analysis. At 1 year after the completion of ADT, 45% of patients (13 of 29 patients) and 29% of patients (5 of 17 patients) with a testosterone level \xe2\x89\xa5100 ng/dL and \xe2\x89\xa5240 ng/dL, respectively, had a PSA <0.2 ng/mL. The median follow-up was 27.5 months (interquartile range, 21.8-38.1 months). Eight patients (20%) were free from PSA progression, 19 patients (46%) did not reinitiate ADT, and 34 patients (83%) were free from metastasis. Sixteen patients (39%) experienced grade 3 and 5 patients (12%) experienced grade 4 toxicities (toxicity was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 3.0]).S:  Multimodality systemic therapy with docetaxel, bevacizumab, and ADT is feasible and produces PSA responses in men with BCR. Long-term follow-up is needed to determine the percentage of patients with a durable PSA response who are able to avoid having to reinitiate prostate cancer therapy.'

S"The objective of this study was to analyze the predictive roles of VEGF/KDR/Ras/MAPK gene expression in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy. Twenty-five patients participating in an open-label phase IV trial (SAiL, MO19390) with available tumor tissues were analyzed. The mRNA expression levels of VEGF, kinase insert domain receptor (KDR), Ras, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in tumor tissues were detected using real-time quantitative PCR methods. The relationships between gene expression and disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were assessed. Patients with lower Ras expression had a longer PFS and OS than patients with higher expression (median PFS, 9.9 vs 5.5 months, \xcf\x87(2)=3.944, P=0.047; OS, 19.3 vs 7.1 months, \xcf\x87(2)=9.384, P=0.002). The PFS and OS of patients with lower and higher MAPK expression exhibited a marginal and significant difference (median PFS, 9.9 vs 5.5 months, \xcf\x87(2)=3.464, P=0.063; OS, 19.3 vs 9.7 months, \xcf\x87(2)=5.298, P=0.021), respectively. Multivariate analyses using Cox's proportional hazards model showed that Ras is an independent predictor of OS (\xcf\x87(2)=9.384, P=0.002). No differences in DCR were found according to Ras expression level. The results indicate that Ras is an independent predictor of OS. Thus, patients with lower Ras expression are most likely to benefit from bevacizumab plus chemotherapy treatment regimen. Patients with higher levels of Ras should receive other inhibitors that target Ras. The results also suggest that gene therapies that decrease RAS expression combined with bevacizumab may improve lung cancer treatment. Although there is a very important implication to patient selection in the target therapy, the data in this study are very preliminary owing to the too small sample size. Therefore, further research involving large numbers of patients and a prospective assessment of low and high RAS mRNA expressions getting the same treatments need to be done before conclusions can be made.

S'The number of approved antiangiogenic drugs is constantly growing and emphasizes the need for predictive biomarkers. The aim of this study was to analyze the predictive value of epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 (EGFL7) and microRNA-126 (miR126) to first-line chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab, in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). A total of 158 patients from two different, but comparable, cohorts were included. Analyses were performed on tumor tissue from the primary tumor either based on a whole-tumor resection or an endoscopic biopsy. EGFL7 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and miR126 by in situ hybridization (ISH). Both biomarkers were quantified by image-guided analyses. Endpoints were response rate (RR) and progression-free survival (PFS). The EGFL7 vessel area (VA) in tumor resections was closely related to treatment response with a median EGFL7 VA in responding patients of 4 [95% confidence interval (CI), 4-6] compared with 8.5 (95% CI, 7-11) in nonresponders, P = 0.0008. This difference translated into a borderline significant difference in PFS (P = 0.06). Furthermore, a significant relationship between high EGFL7 VA and KRAS mutation was detected (P = 0.049). The results showed no significant relationship between the miR126 VA and the clinical endpoints. Our study suggests a predictive value of EGFL7 in regard to first-line chemotherapy and bevacizumab in patients with mCRC and supports the mechanism of a dual blocking of the vascular endothelial growth factor-A and EGFL7 axis in this setting.'

S'"INTRODUCTION" Cetuximab and bevacizumab have each been demonstrated to prolong survival when added to chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the potential benefit of combining cetuximab and bevacizumab together with a platinum-based doublet had not been explored. We designed this phase II trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel, cetuximab, and bevacizumab in chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced, nonsquamous NSCLC.METHODS:  Patients received with up to six cycles of carboplatin (area under curve 6), paclitaxel (200 mg/m(2)), cetuximab (400 mg/m(2) day 1 then 250 mg/m(2) weekly), and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) every 21 days. Patients with an objective response or stable disease received maintenance cetuximab (250 mg/m(2) weekly) and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg every 21 days) until disease progression. The primary endpoint was safety as defined by the frequency and severity of hemorrhagic toxicities. Secondary endpoints included response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, and toxicity. Molecular biomarkers were assessed in an exploratory manner.RESULTS:  The primary endpoint of grade 4 or higher hemorrhage of 2% (95% confidence interval: 0%-7%) met prespecified criteria for safety. One hundred ten patients were enrolled. There were four treatment-related deaths including lung hemorrhage (2), infection (1), and unknown (1). Median progression-free survival was 7 months and median overall survival was 15 months. The response rate was 56% with an overall disease control rate of 77%.: "" This regimen was safe, feasible, and effective as a frontline treatment of advanced NSCLC, providing the basis for the ongoing phase III trial S0819.'

S' Prognosis of unresectable glioblastoma (GB) remains poor, despite temozolomide (TMZ)-based chemoradiation. Activity of bevacizumab (BEV) and irinotecan (IRI) has been reported in recurrent disease. We evaluated BEV and IRI as neo-adjuvant and adjuvant treatment combined with TMZ-based chemoradiation for unresectable GB.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Patients with unresectable GB, age 18-70, IK \xe2\x89\xa550 were eligible. The experimental arm (BEV/IRI) consisted of neo-adjuvant intravenous BEV, 10 mg/kg, and IRI, 125 mg/m(2), every 2 weeks for four cycles before radiotherapy (RT) (60 Gy), concomitant oral TMZ, 75 mg/m(2)/day, and BEV, 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Adjuvant BEV and IRI were given every 2 weeks for 6 months. The control arm consisted of concomitant oral TMZ, 75 mg/m(2)/day during RT, and 150-200 mg/m(2) for 5 days every 28 days for 6 months. The use of BEV was allowed at progression in the control arm.RESULTS:  Patients (120) were included from April 2009 to January 2011. The working hypothesis was that treatment would increase the progression-free survival at 6 month (PFS-6) from 50% to 66%. The primary objective was not achieved, and only 30 out of 60 patients were alive without progression at 6 months (50.0% [IC95% (36.8; 63.1)] in the BEV/IRI arm when 37 out of 60 patients were required according to the Fleming decision rules. PFS-6 was 7.1 months in BEV/IRI versus 5.2 months in the control arm. The median overall survival was not different between the two arms (11.1 months). Main toxicities were three fatal intracranial bleedings, three bile duct or digestive perforations/infections (1 fatal), and six thrombotic episodes in the BEV/IRI arm, whereas there was one intracranial bleeding, two bile duct or digestive perforations/infections (1 fatal), and one thrombotic episode in the control arm.S:  Neo-adjuvant and adjuvant BEV/IRI, combined with TMZ-radiation, is not recommended for further evaluation in the first-line treatment of unresectable GB.'

S' A previous phase 3 trial demonstrated noninferiority in terms of overall survival for combined S-1 (an oral fluoropyrimidine) and carboplatin compared with combined paclitaxel and carboplatin as first-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the current study, the authors evaluated the efficacy and safety of combined S-1, carboplatin, and bevacizumab followed by maintenance with S-1 and bevacizumab in chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC.METHODS:  Patients received carboplatin (area under the concentration-time curve, 5 mg mL(-1) per minute) and bevacizumab (15\xe2\x80\x89mg/kg) on day 1 plus oral S-1 (80 mg/m2 per day) on days 1 through 14 every 21 days for up to 6 cycles. For patients without disease progression, S-1 and bevacizumab were continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity developed.RESULTS:  Forty-eight patients were enrolled in the phase 2 study; of these, 35 patients (72.9%) completed at least 4 cycles. Most toxicities of grade \xe2\x89\xa53 were hematologic, and no increase in relative incidence associated with maintenance with S-1 and bevacizumab was observed.

S' To predict survival in patients with metastatic melanoma by evaluating a combination of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level and initial computed tomographic (CT) findings of tumor devascularization after antiangiogenic therapy.: "" Consent was waived for this institutional review board-approved, retrospective, secondary analysis. Forty-four patients with metastatic melanoma received bevacizumab therapy in a randomized prospective phase II trial. Target lesions on the initial posttherapy CT images were evaluated by using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, the Choi criteria, and Morphology, Attenuation, Size, and Structure (MASS) criteria. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association of baseline clinical variables including serum LDH and imaging findings with progression-free and overall survival. The receiver operating characteristic curve with area under the curve (AUC) was used to evaluate accuracy.RESULTS:  In multivariate analysis, a high baseline serum LDH level was associated with decreased progression-free survival (hazard ratio = 1.29 for each increase of 100 IU/L; P = .002) and overall survival (hazard ratio = 1.44 for each increase of 100 IU/L; P = .001). Evaluation with MASS criteria of the first CT examination after therapy strongly predicted progression-free (P < .001) and overall (P < .001) survival. Baseline serum LDH level was moderately accurate for predicting progression-free survival at 9 months (AUC = 0.793) and overall survival at 18 months (AUC = 0.689). The combination of baseline serum LDH levels and evaluation with MASS criteria at the first CT examination after therapy had significantly higher accuracy for predicting progression-free survival at 9 months (AUC = 0.969) and overall survival at 18 months (AUC = 0.813) than did baseline serum LDH levels alone for prediction of progression-free survival (P = .020).: "" A combination of baseline serum LDH levels and evaluation with MASS criteria at the first CT examination after bevacizumab therapy had the highest accuracy for predicting survival in patients with metastatic melanoma.'

S' Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets VEGF, has shown restricted activity in patients with advanced melanoma. We aimed to assess the role of bevacizumab as adjuvant treatment for patients with resected melanoma at high risk of recurrence. We report results from the preplanned interim analysis.METHODS:  We did a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled phase 3 trial at 48 centres in the UK between July 18, 2007, and March 29, 2012. Patients aged 16 years or older with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage (AJCC) stage IIB, IIC, and III cutaneous melanoma were randomly allocated (1:1), via a central, computer-based minimisation procedure, to receive intravenous bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg, every 3 weeks for 1 year, or to observation. Randomisation was stratified by Breslow thickness of the primary tumour, N stage according to AJCC staging criteria, ulceration of the primary tumour, and patient sex. The primary endpoint was overall survival; secondary endpoints included disease-free interval, distant-metastases interval and quality of life. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. This trial is registered as an International Standardised Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN81261306.FINDINGS: "FINDINGS" 1343 patients were randomised to either the bevacizumab group (n=671) or the observation group (n=672). Median follow-up was 25 months (IQR 16-37) in the bevacizumab group and 25 months (17-37) in the observation group. At the time of interim analysis, 286 (21%) of 1343 enrolled patients had died: 140 (21%) of 671 patients in the bevacizumab group, and 146 (22%) of 672 patients in the observation group. 134 (96%) of patients in the bevacizumab group died because of melanoma versus 139 (95%) in the observation group. We noted no significant difference in overall survival between treatment groups (hazard ratio [HR] 0.97, 95% CI 0.78-1.22; p=0.76); this finding persisted after adjustment for stratification variables (HR 1.03; 95% CI 0.81-1.29; p=0.83). Median duration of treatment with bevacizumab was 51 weeks (IQR 21-52) and dose intensity was 86% (41-96), showing good tolerability. 180 grade 3 or 4 adverse events were recorded in 101 (15%) of 671 patients in the bevacizumab group, and 36 (5%) of 672 patients in the observation group. Bevacizumab resulted in a higher incidence of grade 3 hypertension than did observation (41 [6%] vs one [<1%]). There was an improvement in disease-free interval for patients in the bevacizumab group compared with those in the observation group (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.98, p=0.03), but no significant difference between groups for distant-metastasis-free interval (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.73-1.06, p=0.18). No significant differences were noted between treatment groups in the standardised area under the curve for any of the quality-of-life scales over 36 months. Three adverse drug reactions were regarded as both serious and unexpected: one patient had optic neuritis after the first bevacizumab infusion, a second patient had persistent erectile dysfunction, and a third patient died of a haemopericardium after receiving two bevacizumab infusions and was later identified to have had significant predisposing cardiovascular risk factors.INTERPRETATION: "INTERPRETATION" Bevacizumab has promising tolerability.

S'The purpose of the study is to compare single injection of intravitreal diclofenac (IVD) with intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) in the treatment of eyes with na\xc3\xafve diabetic macular edema (DME). In this randomized clinical trial, 57 eyes of 57 patients were randomly assigned to IVD group (30 eyes), cases who received a single intravitreal injection of diclofenac (500 \xce\xbcg/0.1 ml), and IVB group (27 eyes), cases who received a single intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (1.25 mg). Change in best-corrected visual acuity in logMAR at week 12 was the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcomes included changes in central macular thickness, macular leakage, and potential injection-related complications. Best-corrected visual acuity improved significantly more in the IVD group than in the IVB group (P = 0.033), from 0.57 \xc2\xb1 0.25 to 0.49 \xc2\xb1 0.31 versus 0.55 \xc2\xb1 0.24-0.59 \xc2\xb1 0.27 logMAR at 12 weeks, respectively. However, the difference of macular thickness changes was in favor of IVB, but not to a significant level. The amount of change in leakage was not significantly different between the groups either. None of the eyes, in either group, developed ocular hypertension (\xe2\x89\xa523 mmHg) or cataract progression. No important injection-related complication was observed during the study period. This study demonstrated the superiority of IVD over IVB in the treatment of na\xc3\xafve DME regarding functional, but not anatomical outcomes. Therefore, using IVD as an adjunct or even alternative to other treatments might enhance the functional outcomes in such cases. Further studies are warranted to confirm potential benefit of IVD observed in this study.'

S' To determine whether a dexamethasone intravitreal implant 0.7 mg (dexamethasone delivery system [DDS], Ozurdex) combined with bevacizumab 1.25 mg (Avastin) provides greater benefit than bevacizumab monotherapy in eyes with diabetic macular edema with incomplete response to multiple antivascular endothelial growth factor injections.METHODS:  Eyes with diabetic macular edema were randomly assigned to receive combination therapy (bevacizumab plus DDS) or bevacizumab monotherapy. Combination therapy eyes received intravitreal bevacizumab at baseline, DDS at Month 1, and subsequent DDS (at Months 5 and 9), whereas monotherapy eyes received bevacizumab (monthly) if indicated. Eyes were eligible for retreatment if the central subfield thickness measured >250 \xce\xbcm, and Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study visual acuity was <80 letters (20/25).RESULTS:  Forty eyes of 30 patients were enrolled. The mean visual acuity changes from baseline to 12 months were similar in the 2 groups (combined: +5.4 letters; bevacizumab: +4.9 letters; difference = 0.2 letters, 95% confidence interval = -5.9 to 6.3; P = 0.75). The mean reduction in central subfield thickness was greater in the combination group (-45 \xce\xbcm vs. -30 \xce\xbcm, difference = 69 \xce\xbcm, 95% confidence interval = 9-129; P = 0.03) and more patients in the combination group had central subfield thickness <250 \xce\xbcm. The combined treatment group received three fewer supplemental injections of bevacizumab, but this was counterbalanced by the need for an average of 2.1 DDS injections.S:  The dexamethasone implant combined with bevacizumab significantly improves visual acuity and significantly improves macular morphology in eyes with refractory diabetic macular edema, although visual acuity changes are not superior to continued bevacizumab monotherapy.'

This multicenter study across several Asian countries was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination in this population.METHODS:  Patients with histology-proven HCC, advanced disease and Child-Pugh class A liver function received bevacizumab 5 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks and erlotinib 150 mg/day orally as first-line therapy. The primary end point was progression-free survival at 16 weeks (PFS-16W). The expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), phospho-AKT and vascular endothelial growth factor, the microvessel density and the EGFR gene copy number in HCC tissues were correlated with treatment efficacy.RESULTS:  Fifty-one patients were enrolled. The PFS-16W was 35.3% (95% CI 22.4-49.9), the median PFS was 2.9 months (95% CI, 1.3-4.4) and the median overall survival was 10.7 months (95% CI, 6.2-15.2). Grade 3/4 toxicities were uncommon, including rash, acne (10% each), diarrhea (6%) and gastrointestinal bleeding (4%). None of the evaluated biomarkers correlated with disease control or PFS.S:  Bevacizumab plus erlotinib showed good tolerability and modest activity in this Asian cohort. Further studies are warranted to identify the predictive biomarkers of this combination.'

S' The GeparQuinto study showed that adding bevacizumab to 24 weeks of anthracycline-taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy increases pathological complete response (pCR) rates overall and specifically in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). No difference in pCR rate was observed for adding everolimus to paclitaxel in nonearly responding patients. Here, we present disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) analyses.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Patients (n = 1948) with HER2-negative tumors of a median tumor size of 4 cm were randomly assigned to neoadjuvant treatment with epirubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel (EC-T) with or without eight infusions of bevacizumab every 3 weeks before surgery. Patients without clinical response to EC \xc2\xb1 Bevacizumab were randomized to 12 weekly cycles paclitaxel with or without everolimus 5 mg/day. To detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.75 (\xce\xb1 = 0.05, \xce\xb2 = 0.8) 379 events had to be observed in the bevacizumab arms.RESULTS:  With a median follow-up of 3.8 years, 3-year DFS was 80.8% and 3-year OS was 89.7%. Outcome was not different for patients receiving bevacizumab (HR 1.03; P = 0.784 for DFS and HR 0.974; P = 0.842 for OS) compared with patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Patients with TNBC similarly showed no improvement in DFS (HR = 0.99; P = 0.941) and OS (HR = 1.02; P = 0.891) when treated with bevacizumab. No other predefined subgroup (HR+/HER2-; locally advanced (cT4 or cN3) or not; cT1-3 or cT4; pCR or not) showed a significant benefit. No difference in DFS (HR 0.997; P = 0.987) and OS (HR 1.11; P = 0.658) was observed for nonearly responding patients receiving paclitaxel with or without everolimus overall as well as in subgroups.S:  Long-term results, in opposite to the results of pCR, do not support the neoadjuvant use of bevacizumab in addition to an anthracycline-taxane-based chemotherapy or everolimus in addition to paclitaxel for nonearly responding patients.'

S'"BACKGROUND/AIMS" To compare the efficacy of intravitreal injections of dexamethasone implants (IVD) with those of bevacizumab (IVB) for the treatment of macular oedema associated with branch retinal vein occlusion.METHODS:  A total of 19 patients (19 eyes) were included in this prospective pilot study. Initially, 8 eyes received three IVBs (group 1) and 11 received one IVD (group 2). All the patients underwent a 1-, 3-, 4- and 6-month follow-up visit. A repeated IVB (group 1) or IVD (group 2) was proposed at 4 months when necessary.RESULTS:  The mean visual acuity was significantly better 1 month after treatment in group 2, while the mean central macular thickness was also significantly lower in group 2. However, there was no longer any difference between the two groups at 3, 4 and 6 months, neither in terms of visual acuity nor in terms of retinal thickness. More than three IVBs were needed in 3 of 10 patients in group 1 while two IVDs were required in 10 of 11 patients in group 2.: "" There was no significant difference between the two treatment regimens at the 6-month follow-up visit. A more rapid functional and anatomical efficacy was noted with IVD during the first month; however, reinjection at 4 months seemed more frequent with IVD than with IVB treatment.'

S'"INTRODUCTION" Bevacizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel. ARIES (Avastin Regimens: Investigation of Effectiveness and Safety), a prospective observational cohort study, evaluated outcomes in a large, community-based population of patients with first-line NSCLC.METHODS:  From 2006 to 2009, ARIES enrolled patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who were eligible for bevacizumab, excluding those with predominantly squamous histology. Patients were required to provide informed consent and to have initiated bevacizumab with chemotherapy within 4 months before enrollment. There were no protocol-defined treatments or assessments. The dosing of bevacizumab and chemotherapy, and the choice of chemotherapy regimen, was at the discretion of the treating physician.RESULTS:  ARIES enrolled 1967 patients with first-line NSCLC. At study closure, median follow-up was 12.5 months (range, 0.2-65.5). Median age was 65 years (range, 31-93), and 252 patients (12.8%) identified as never smokers. Median progression-free survival was 6.6 months (95% confidence interval, 6.3-6.9), and median overall survival was 13.0 months (95% confidence interval, 12.2-13.8) with first-line bevacizumab plus chemotherapy. Incidences of bevacizumab-associated adverse events (19.7% overall) were consistent with those in randomized controlled trials of bevacizumab in NSCLC.: "" Results from ARIES demonstrate similar outcomes to randomized controlled trials of bevacizumab when added to standard chemotherapy in a real-world patient population with advanced NSCLC.'

S'Patients with recurrence of high-grade glioma (HGG) after bevacizumab (BEV) have an extremely poor prognosis. Etirinotecan pegol (EP) is the first long-acting topoisomerase-I inhibitor designed to concentrate in and provide continuous tumor exposure throughout the entire chemotherapy cycle. Here we report results of a Phase 2, single arm, open-label trial evaluating EP in HGG patients who progressed after BEV. Patients age >18 with histologically proven anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma (GB) who previously received standard chemo-radiation and recurred after BEV were eligible. A predicted life expectancy >6 weeks and KPS \xe2\x89\xa5 50 were required. The primary endpoint was PFS at 6-weeks. Secondary endpoint was overall survival from first EP infusion. Response was assessed by RANO criteria. Single agent EP was administered IV every 3 weeks at 145 mg/m2. Patients did not receive BEV while on EP. 20 patients (90 % GB) were enrolled with a median age of 50 and median KPS of 70. Three patients with GB (16.7 % of GB) had partial MRI responses. 6-week PFS was 55 %. Median and 6-month PFS were 2.2 months (95 % CI 1.4-3.4 months) and 11.2 % (95 % CI 1.9-28.9 %) respectively. Median overall survival from first EP infusion was 4.5 months (95 % CI 2.4-5.9). Only one patient had grade 3 toxicity (diarrhea with dehydration) attributable to EP. Hematologic toxicity was mild. Three patients had confirmed partial responses according to RANO criteria. These clinical data combined with a favorable safety profile warrant further clinical investigation of this agent in HGG.'

S' Fixed-dose rate gemcitabine plus docetaxel achieves objective response in 35% of patients with uterine leiomyosarcoma (uLMS). This study aimed to determine whether the addition of bevacizumab to gemcitabine-docetaxel increases progression-free survival (PFS) in uLMS.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  In this phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients with chemotherapy-naive, metastatic, unresectable uLMS were randomly assigned to gemcitabine-docetaxel plus bevacizumab or gemcitabine-docetaxel plus placebo. PFS, overall survival (OS), and objective response rates (ORRs) were compared to determine superiority. Target accrual was 130 patients to detect an increase in median PFS from 4 months (gemcitabine-docetaxel plus placebo) to 6.7 months (gemcitabine-docetaxel plus bevacizumab). Treatment effects on PFS and OS were described by hazard ratios (HRs), median times to event, and 95% CIs.RESULTS:  In all, 107 patients were accrued: gemcitabine-docetaxel plus placebo (n = 54) and gemcitabine-docetaxel plus bevacizumab (n = 53). Accrual was stopped early for futility. No statistically significant differences in grade 3 to 4 toxicities were observed.

S' Standard therapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma is radiotherapy plus temozolomide. In this phase 3 study, we evaluated the effect of the addition of bevacizumab to radiotherapy-temozolomide for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma.METHODS:  We randomly assigned patients with supratentorial glioblastoma to receive intravenous bevacizumab (10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks) or placebo, plus radiotherapy (2 Gy 5 days a week; maximum, 60 Gy) and oral temozolomide (75 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day) for 6 weeks. After a 28-day treatment break, maintenance bevacizumab (10 mg per kilogram intravenously every 2 weeks) or placebo, plus temozolomide (150 to 200 mg per square meter per day for 5 days), was continued for six 4-week cycles, followed by bevacizumab monotherapy (15 mg per kilogram intravenously every 3 weeks) or placebo until the disease progressed or unacceptable toxic effects developed. The coprimary end points were investigator-assessed progression-free survival and overall survival.RESULTS:  A total of 458 patients were assigned to the bevacizumab group, and 463 patients to the placebo group. The median progression-free survival was longer in the bevacizumab group than in the placebo group (10.6 months vs. 6.2 months; stratified hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55 to 0.74; P<0.001). The benefit with respect to progression-free survival was observed across subgroups. Overall survival did not differ significantly between groups (stratified hazard ratio for death, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.02; P=0.10). The respective overall survival rates with bevacizumab and placebo were 72.4% and 66.3% at 1 year (P=0.049) and 33.9% and 30.1% at 2 years (P=0.24). Baseline health-related quality of life and performance status were maintained longer in the bevacizumab group, and the glucocorticoid requirement was lower. More patients in the bevacizumab group than in the placebo group had grade 3 or higher adverse events (66.8% vs. 51.3%) and grade 3 or higher adverse events often associated with bevacizumab (32.5% vs. 15.8%).'

S' Concurrent treatment with temozolomide and radiotherapy followed by maintenance temozolomide is the standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor A, is currently approved for recurrent glioblastoma. Whether the addition of bevacizumab would improve survival among patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma is not known.METHODS:  In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we treated adults who had centrally confirmed glioblastoma with radiotherapy (60 Gy) and daily temozolomide. Treatment with bevacizumab or placebo began during week 4 of radiotherapy and was continued for up to 12 cycles of maintenance chemotherapy. At disease progression, the assigned treatment was revealed, and bevacizumab therapy could be initiated or continued. The trial was designed to detect a 25% reduction in the risk of death and a 30% reduction in the risk of progression or death, the two coprimary end points, with the addition of bevacizumab.RESULTS:  A total of 978 patients were registered, and 637 underwent randomization. There was no significant difference in the duration of overall survival between the bevacizumab group and the placebo group (median, 15.7 and 16.1 months, respectively; hazard ratio for death in the bevacizumab group, 1.13). Progression-free survival was longer in the bevacizumab group (10.7 months vs. 7.3 months; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.79). There were modest increases in rates of hypertension, thromboembolic events, intestinal perforation, and neutropenia in the bevacizumab group. Over time, an increased symptom burden, a worse quality of life, and a decline in neurocognitive function were more frequent in the bevacizumab group.'

S' The randomized, phase III AVAPERL trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of bevacizumab maintenance with or without pemetrexed in nonsquamous nonsmall-cell lung cancer (nsNSCLC). Progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly prolonged with bevacizumab-pemetrexed, but overall survival (OS) data were immature. In this article, we report an independent, updated analysis of survival outcomes in AVAPERL.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Patients with advanced nsNSCLC received first-line bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg), cisplatin (75 mg/m(2)), and pemetrexed (500 mg/m(2)) every 3 weeks (q3w) for four cycles. Nonprogressing patients were randomized to maintenance bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg) or bevacizumab-pemetrexed (500 mg/m(2)) q3w until progression or consent withdrawal. The primary end point of the trial was PFS; in this independent OS analysis, participating study centers were contacted to collect survival data on patients still alive at the time of the first analysis.RESULTS:  A total of 376 patients received induction treatment. Disease control was confirmed in 71.9% of patients; 253 patients were randomized to maintenance treatment with bevacizumab (n = 125) or bevacizumab-pemetrexed (n = 128). At a median follow-up of 14.8 months, patients allocated to bevacizumab-pemetrexed had significantly improved PFS versus those on bevacizumab when measured from randomization [7.4 versus 3.7 months, hazard ratio (HR), 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44-0.75); P < 0.0001]. OS events occurred in 58% of all patients. OS was numerically longer with bevacizumab-pemetrexed versus bevacizumab when measured from randomization [17.1 versus 13.2 months, HR 0.87 (0.63-1.21); P = 0.29]. Second-line therapy was administered in 77% and 70% of patients in the bevacizumab and bevacizumab-pemetrexed arms, respectively. No new adverse events were reported during this updated analysis.: "" In an unselected population of nsNSCLC patients achieving disease control on platinum-based induction therapy, maintenance with bevacizumab-pemetrexed was associated with a nonsignificant increase in OS over bevacizumab alone.'

S'Studies on the monoclonal VEGF-A antibody bevacizumab gave raise to questions regarding the lack of an overall survival benefit, the optimal timing in the disease course and potential combination and salvage therapies. We retrospectively assessed survival, radiological progression type on bevacizumab and efficacy of salvage therapies in 42 patients with recurrent malignant gliomas who received bevacizumab and nitrosourea sequentially. 15 patients received bevacizumab followed by nitrosourea at progression and 27 patients vice versa. Time to treatment failure, defined as time from initiation of one to failure of the other treatment, was similar in both groups (9.6 vs. 9.2 months, log rank p = 0.19). Progression-free survival on nitrosoureas was comparable in both groups, while progression-free survival on bevacizumab was longer in the group receiving bevacizumab first (5.3 vs. 4.1 months, log rank p = 0.03). Survival times were similar for patients with grade III (n = 9) and grade IV (n = 33) tumors. Progression-free survival on bevacizumab for patients developing contrast-enhancing T1 progression was longer than for patients who displayed a non-enhancing T2 progression. However, post-progression survival times after bevacizumab failure were not different. Earlier treatment with bevacizumab was not associated with better outcome in this series. The fact that earlier as compared to later bevacizumab treatment does not result in a different time to treatment failure highlights the challenge for first-line or recurrence trials with bevacizumab to demonstrate an overall survival benefit if crossover of bevacizumab-na\xc3\xafve patients after progression occurs.'

The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of the intravitreal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor application alone or combined with macular focal/grid lasephotocoagulation compared with laser treatment alone.METHODS:  This prospective randomized clinical trial included 72 patients (120 treated eyes) with varying degrees of DR and DME. The DME treatment included intravitreal VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab (Avasting) application, with and without laser treatment. Bevacizumab (1.25 mg/0.05 mL) was administered intravitreally in 4-6-week intervals. Laser is applied 4-6 weeks after last dose of the drug as a part of combined treatment, or as the primary treatment.RESULTS:  The mean reduction in central macular thickness (CMT) for the eyes (n = 31) treated with bevacizumab alone was 162.23 .rm, for the eyes (n = 53) treated with combined treatment the mean reduction in CMT was 124.24 pm, both statistically significant at p < 0.001. Laser macular photocolagulation as a part of combined treatment (in 53 eyes) significantly contributed to the CMT reduction, based on the paired t-test results (366.28 vs. 323.0 pLm at p < 0.05). In our study, the mean visual acuity improvement of 0.161 logMAR was achieved in the group of eyes treated with bevacizumab alone, and 0.093 logMAR in the group with combined treatment, both statistically significant atp < 0.05. The effect of laser photocolagulation alone on visual acuity and\'CMT was not statistically significant.: "" Treatment with bevacizumab alone or within combined treatment is more effective in treating DME than conventional macular laser treatment alone, both anatomically and functionally.'

If signs of recurrent disease appeared, the treatment interval was shortened by 2 weeks at a time.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES" Change in visual acuity at 1 year.RESULTS:  Between March 2009 and July 2012, 441 patients were randomized at 10 ophthalmological centers in Norway. The 1-year visit was completed by 371 patients. In the per protocol analysis at 1 year, bevacizumab was equivalent to ranibizumab, with 7.9 and 8.2 mean letters gained, respectively (95% confidence interval [CI] of mean difference, -2.4 to 2.9; P = 0.845). The intention-to-treat analysis was concordant. There was no significant difference in measured central retinal thickness (CRT), with a mean decrease of -112 \xce\xbcm for bevacizumab and -120 \xce\xbcm for ranibizumab (95% CI of mean difference, -13 to 28; P = 0.460). There was a statistically significant difference (P = 0.001) between the drugs regarding the number of treatments: 8.9 for bevacizumab and 8.0 for ranibizumab. There were fewer arteriothrombotic events in the bevacizumab group (1.4%) than in the ranibizumab group (4.5%) (P = 0.050) and significantly more cardiac events in the ranibizumab group (P = 0.036). However, patients treated with ranibizumab more often had a history of myocardial infarction (P = 0.021).S:  Bevacizumab and ranibizumab had equivalent effects on visual acuity at 1 year when administered according to a treat-and-extend protocol. The visual acuity results at 1 year were comparable to those of other clinical trials with monthly treatment. The numbers of serious adverse events were small.'

S' Chemotherapy plus bevacizumab is a standard option for first-line treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. We assessed whether no continuation is non-inferior to continuation of bevacizumab after completing first-line chemotherapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  In an open-label, phase III multicentre trial, patients with mCRC without disease progression after 4-6 months of standard first-line chemotherapy plus bevacizumab were randomly assigned to continuing bevacizumab at a standard dose or no treatment. CT scans were done every 6 weeks until disease progression. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP). A non-inferiority limit for hazard ratio (HR) of 0.727 was chosen to detect a difference in TTP of 6 weeks or less, with a one-sided significance level of 10% and a statistical power of 85%.RESULTS:  The intention-to-treat population comprised 262 patients: median follow-up was 36.7 months. The median TTP was 4.1 [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.1-5.4] months for bevacizumab continuation versus 2.9 (95% CI 2.8-3.8) months for no continuation; HR 0.74 (95% CI 0.58-0.96). Non-inferiority could not be demonstrated. The median overall survival was 25.4 months for bevacizumab continuation versus 23.8 months (HR 0.83; 95% CI 0.63-1.1; P = 0.2) for no continuation. Severe adverse events were uncommon in the bevacizumab continuation arm. Costs for bevacizumab continuation were estimated to be \xe2\x88\xbc30,000 USD per patient.S:  Non-inferiority could not be demonstrated for treatment holidays versus continuing bevacizumab monotheray, after 4-6 months of standard first-line chemotherapy plus bevacizumab. Based on no impact on overall survival and increased treatment costs, bevacizumab as a single agent is of no meaningful therapeutic value. More efficient treatment approaches are needed to maintain control of stabilized disease following induction therapy.'

S'"S" Predictive factors for efficacy of bevacizumab in advanced ovarian cancer have remained elusive. We investigated ascites both as a prognostic factor and as a predictor of efficacy for bevacizumab.METHODS:  Using data from GOG 0218, patients receiving cytotoxic therapy plus concurrent and maintenance bevacizumab were compared to those receiving cytotoxic therapy plus placebo. The presence of ascites was determined prospectively. Chi-square and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests compared baseline variables between subgroups. Survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate independent prognostic factors and estimate their covariate-adjusted effects on survival.RESULTS:  Treatment arms were balanced with respect to ascites and other prognostic factors. Overall, 886 (80%) women had ascites, 221 (20%) did not. Those with ascites were more likely to have: poorer performance status (p<0.001); serous histology (p=0.012); higher baseline CA125 (p<0.001); and suboptimal cytoreduction (p=0.004). In multivariate survival analysis, ascites was prognostic of poor OS (Adjusted HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.00-1.48, p=0.045), but not PFS. In predictive analysis, patients without ascites treated with bevacizumab had no significant improvement in either PFS (AHR 0.81, 95% CI 0.59-1.10, p=0.18) or OS (AHR 0.94, 95% CI 0.65-1.36, p=0.76). Patients with ascites treated with bevacizumab had significantly improved PFS (AHR 0.71, 95% CI 0.62-0.81, p<0.001) and OS (AHR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70-0.96, p=0.014).S:  Ascites in women with advanced ovarian cancer is prognostic of poor overall survival. Ascites may predict the population of women more likely to derive long-term benefit from bevacizumab.'

S'Bevacizumab blocks the effects of VEGF and may allow for more aggressive radiotherapy schedules. We evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiation therapy with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide and bevacizumab in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma were treated with hypofractionated intensity modulated radiation therapy to the surgical cavity and residual tumor with a 1 cm margin (PTV1) to 60 Gy and to the T2 abnormality with a 1 cm margin (PTV2) to 30 Gy in 10 daily fractions over 2 weeks. Concurrent temozolomide (75 mg/m(2) daily) and bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) was administered followed by adjuvant temozolomide (200 mg/m(2)) on a standard 5/28 day cycle and bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) every 2 weeks for 6 months. Thirty newly diagnosed patients were treated on study. Median PTV1 volume was 131.1 cm(3) and the median PTV2 volume was 342.6 cm(3). Six-month progression-free survival (PFS) was 90 %, with median follow-up of 15.9 months. The median PFS was 14.3 months, with a median overall survival (OS) of 16.3 months. Grade 4 hematologic toxicity included neutropenia (10 %) and thrombocytopenia (17 %). Grades 3/4 non-hematologic toxicity included fatigue (13 %), wound dehiscence (7 %) and stroke, pulmonary embolism and nausea each in 1 patient. Presumed radiation necrosis with clinical decline was seen in 50 % of patients, two with autopsy documentation. The study was closed early to accrual due to this finding. This study demonstrated 90 % 6-month PFS and OS comparable to historic data in patients receiving standard treatment. Bevacizumab did not prevent radiation necrosis associated with this hypofractionated radiation regimen and large PTV volumes may have contributed to high rates of presumed radiation necrosis.'

S'"IMPORTANCE" Children born prematurely who develop retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) often develop myopia, and those who require laser treatment may develop very high myopia, which has considerable clinical consequences.: "" To report refractive outcomes in preterm infants who developed ROP in zone I or zone II posterior as stage 3+ ROP or aggressive posterior ROP (APROP).DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: "DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS" All infants received intravitreal bevacizumab or laser therapy in a prospective, stratified, randomized, controlled, masked, multicenter clinical trial, Bevacizumab Eliminates the Angiogenic Threat for ROP (BEAT-ROP). Children who received intravitreal bevacizumab or laser in the BEAT-ROP clinical trial, with treatment randomized by infant, underwent cycloplegic retinoscopic refraction at a mean age of 2\xc2\xbd years. Fifteen centers with both pediatric and vitreoretinal ophthalmologists participating in level 3 neonatal intensive care units in academic centers with institutional review board approval were included in the trial. Of the originally enrolled 150 infants (300 eyes) in the BEAT-ROP clinical trial, 13 infants (26 eyes) died (6 received intravitreal bevacizumab; 7 received laser) and 19 eyes had intraocular surgery (6 infants bilaterally).

Mean (SD) spherical equivalent refractions were as follows: zone I, -1.51 (3.42) diopters (D) in 52 eyes that received intravitreal bevacizumab and -8.44 (7.57) D in 35 eyes that received laser treatment (P <\xe2\x80\x89.001); and zone II posterior, -0.58 (2.53) D in 58 eyes that received intravitreal bevacizumab and -5.83 (5.87) D in 66 eyes that received laser treatment (P <\xe2\x80\x89.001). Very high myopia (\xe2\x89\xa5-8.00 D) occurred in zone I in 2 of 52 (3.8%) eyes that received intravitreal bevacizumab and in 18 of 35 (51.4%) eyes that received laser treatment (P <\xe2\x80\x89.001). Very high myopia occurred in zone II posterior in 1 of 58 (1.7%) eyes that received intravitreal bevacizumab and in 24 of 66 (36.4%) eyes that received laser treatment (P <\xe2\x80\x89.001).S AND RELEVANCE: "S AND RELEVANCE" More very high myopia was found in eyes that received laser treatment than in eyes that received intravitreal bevacizumab. This difference is possibly related to anterior segment development that is present with intravitreal bevacizumab but minimal or absent following laser treatment.'

S' Elevated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was associated with poor prognosis in leptomeningeal carcinomatosis and anti-angiogenic therapy was found to prolong the survival of mice in preclinical studies. This prospective pilot study investigated the efficacy of anti-VEGF therapy plus chemotherapy in patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis originating from breast cancer.METHODS:  Eligible patients were scheduled to receive bevacizumab combined with etoposide and cisplatin (BEEP) every 3\xc2\xa0weeks for a maximum of 6\xc2\xa0cycles or until unacceptable toxicity. The primary objective was the central nervous system (CNS)-specific response rate, which was defined as disappearance of cancer cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and an improved or stabilized neurologic status. The impact of VEGF inhibition on etoposide penetration into the CSF was analyzed.RESULTS:  Eight patients were enrolled. The CNS-specific response rate was 60% in 5 evaluable patients. According to intent-to-treat analysis, the median overall survival of the eight patients was 4.7\xc2\xa0months (95% confidence interval, CI, 0.3-9.0) and the neurologic progression-free survival was 4.7\xc2\xa0months (95% CI 0-10.5). The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia (23.1%), leukopenia (23.1%), and hyponatremia (23.1%). The etoposide concentrations in the CSF were much lower than those in plasma, and bevacizumab did not increase etoposide delivery to the CSF.S:  BEEP exhibited promising efficacy in breast cancer patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.

Nevertheless, new strategies are needed to further extend progression-free survival and overall survival with acceptable toxicity and tolerability for this population. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of the combination of erlotinib and bevacizumab compared with erlotinib alone in patients with non-squamous NSCLC with activating EGFR mutation-positive disease.METHODS:  In this open-label, randomised, multicentre, phase 2 study, patients from 30 centres across Japan with stage IIIB/IV or recurrent non-squamous NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1, and no previous chemotherapy for advanced disease received erlotinib 150 mg/day plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks or erlotinib 150 mg/day monotherapy as a first-line therapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, as determined by an independent review committee. Randomisation was done with a dynamic allocation method, and the analysis used a modified intention-to-treat approach, including all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment and had tumour assessment at least once after randomisation. This study is registered with the Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center, number JapicCTI-111390.FINDINGS: "FINDINGS" Between Feb 21, 2011, and March 5, 2012, 154 patients were enrolled. 77 were randomly assigned to receive erlotinib and bevacizumab and 77 to erlotinib alone, of whom 75 patients in the erlotinib plus bevacizumab group and 77 in the erlotinib alone group were included in the efficacy analyses.

S'"INTRODUCTION" Cisplatin with pemetrexed (CP) and carboplatin with paclitaxel and bevacizumab (CbTB) are standard first-line treatments for patients with advanced nonsquamous (NS) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Quality of life (QoL) is a key objective in the management of advanced NSCLC. Thus, effect on QoL could be an additional factor in the choice of treatment.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Patients with untreated stage IIIB/IV NS-NSCLC and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 were randomized to receive first-line chemotherapy with cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) and pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2), every 3 weeks, for 6 cycles followed by maintenance pemetrexed; or carboplatin area under the curve 6, paclitaxel 200 mg/m(2), and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg, every 3 weeks, for 6 cycles followed by maintenance bevacizumab. The primary end point was the difference in QoL between the 2 treatment arms after 12 weeks of maintenance, measured using the EuroQoL 5 Dimensions-Index (EQ5D-I) and EQ5D-visual analogue scale (EQ5D-VAS).RESULTS:  One hundred eighteen patients were randomized to CP (n = 60) or CbTB (n = 58). Baseline characteristics were well balanced. The proportion of patients evaluable for the primary end point was lower than planned. After 12 weeks of maintenance, the difference between mean changes in EQ5D-I was 0.137, favoring CP (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.02 to 0.29, Wilcoxon P = .078), although not statistically significant; and the difference between mean changes in EQ5D-VAS was 0.97 (95% CI, -9.37 to 11.31, Wilcoxon P = .41).: "" Although the study was underpowered because of a small number of patients evaluable for the primary end point, QoL did not differ between treatment arms. Other factors such as comorbidities and schedule should be used when deciding on first-line treatment.'

S'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project protocol C-08 tested the worth of adding 1 year of bevacizumab to oxaliplatin-based standard adjuvant chemotherapy regimen in the treatment of stage II/III colon cancer. Although the overall result was negative, the possibility that a molecularly defined subset could benefit from bevacizumab cannot be ruled out. We performed post hoc Cox regression analyses to test for marker-by-treatment interactions for standard pathological features and survival analyses using the Kaplan-Meier method. All statistical tests were two-sided and considered statistically significant at the .05 level. Patients diagnosed with mismatch repair defective (dMMR) tumors derived statistically significant survival benefit from the addition of bevacizumab (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.29 to 0.94; P = .02) in contrast with no benefit in patients diagnosed with mismatch repair proficient tumors (HR = 1.03; 95% CI = 0.84 to 1.27; p = .78; P(interaction)= .04). Although a post hoc finding, this data suggests that a molecularly defined subset of colon cancer patients may derive clinical benefit from antiangiogenesis agents and underscores the need for independent validation in other clinical trials.'

S'"" To evaluate the effect of adding bevacizumab to adjuvant paclitaxel and carboplatin and as maintenance on progression-free survival (PFS) in advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma (EMCA).METHODS:  A phase II trial was conducted in patients with measurable disease. Paclitaxel (175mg/m(2)/3h), carboplatin (AUC 5) and bevacizumab (15mg/kg) were administered q 21 days. Patients with a complete response after 6-8cycles received maintenance therapy with bevacizumab 15mg/kg q 21 days for 16cycles. Based on GOG 177 which had a 6-month PFS rate of 59%, an increase in 6-month PFS to 72% with the treatment regimen was considered of clinical interest.RESULTS:  15 patients were enrolled on protocol when accrual to the study was discontinued due to the initiation of a national randomized phase II trial. A total of 127 courses (median 8, range 1-20) of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab combination therapy were administered. One patient suffered a bowel perforation after her first course of therapy and was inevaluable for response. Fourteen of the 15 patients (93%, 95% CI: 82-100) were progression free at 6months. The median follow-up was 36months (7-58+). The median PFS was 18months (CI: 11-25). Five complete responses and 6 partial responses were seen for an overall response rate of 73% (CI: 45-91). The median overall survival was 58months (CI: 48-68).S:  The bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin regimen is active and tolerable in advanced and recurrent EMCA. Its impact awaits results of the recently completed randomized phase II trial.'

Eligible patients received maintenance until disease progression: pemetrexed plus bevacizumab (for the PemCBev group) or bevacizumab (for the PacCBev group). The primary end point of this superiority study was overall survival (OS).RESULTS:  Patients were randomly assigned to PemCBev (n = 472) or PacCBev (n = 467). For PemCBev versus PacCBev, OS hazard ratio (HR) was 1.00 (median OS, 12.6 v 13.4 months; P = .949); progression-free survival (PFS) HR was 0.83 (median PFS, 6.0 v 5.6 months; P = .012); overall response rate was 34.1% versus 33.0%; and disease control rate was 65.9% versus 69.8%. Significantly more study drug-related grade 3 or 4 anemia (14.5% v 2.7%), thrombocytopenia (23.3% v 5.6%), and fatigue (10.9% v 5.0%) occurred with PemCBev; significantly more grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (40.6% v 25.8%), febrile neutropenia (4.1% v 1.4%), sensory neuropathy (4.1% v 0%), and alopecia (grade 1 or 2; 36.8% v 6.6%) occurred with PacCBev.: "" OS did not improve with the PemCBev regimen compared with the PacCBev regimen, although PFS was significantly improved with PemCBev.

S' To compare the 3-year visual outcome after double therapy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) with intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) and triple therapy of PDT combined with IVB and subtenon triamcinolone acetonide (STTA) injections for polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV).DESIGN: "DESIGN" Retrospective, comparative, interventional case series.METHODS:  Medical records for 36 eyes in 36 patients (33 men, 3 women; mean age 73.5\xe2\x80\x85years old; range 63-82\xe2\x80\x85years old) with treatment-naive subfoveal PCV were reviewed retrospectively. Of the 36 eyes, 17 were treated with double therapy and 19 with triple therapy.RESULTS:  The change in visual acuity after triple therapy was significantly better than that after double therapy (p<0.05). At 36\xe2\x80\x85months, improvement in visual acuity was seen in 5 eyes (29.4%) in the double therapy group and 10 eyes (52.6%) in the triple therapy group. Retreatment using the initial treatment was performed for six eyes (35.3%) in the double therapy group and five eyes (26.3%) in the triple therapy group, and treatment-free period was significantly longer in the triple therapy group (p<0.05). The mean number of additional antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy was higher in the double therapy group. Post-treatment vitreous haemorrhage or retinal pigment epithelium tear occurred only in the double therapy group, in one eye (5.9%) and one eye (5.9%), respectively.S:  Initial therapy consisting of a single session of PDT combined with IVB and STTA improves vision in treatment-naive subfoveal PCV. Compared with double therapy, this triple therapy may be more effective for PCV.'

S' There are few effective therapies for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs). Recent placebo-controlled phase III trials of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/platelet-derived growth factor receptor inhibitor sunitinib have noted improved progression-free survival (PFS). Preclinical studies have suggested enhanced antitumor effects with combined mTOR and VEGF pathway-targeted therapy. We conducted a clinical trial to evaluate combination therapy against these targets in PNETs.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  We conducted a two-stage single-arm phase II trial of the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus 25 mg intravenously (IV) once per week and the VEGF-A monoclonal antibody bevacizumab 10 mg/kg IV once every 2 weeks in patients with well or moderately differentiated PNETs and progressive disease by RECIST within 7 months of study entry. Coprimary end points were tumor response rate and 6-month PFS.RESULTS:  A total of 58 patients were enrolled, and 56 patients were eligible for response assessment. Confirmed response rate (RR) was 41% (23 of 56 patients). PFS at 6 months was 79% (44 of 56). Median PFS was 13.2 months (95% CI, 11.2 to 16.6). Median overall survival was 34 months (95% CI, 27.1 to not reached). For evaluable patients, the most common grade 3 to 4 adverse events attributed to therapy were hypertension (21%), fatigue (16%), lymphopenia (14%), and hyperglycemia (14%).: "" The combination of temsirolimus and bevacizumab had substantial activity and reasonable tolerability in a multicenter phase II trial, with RR of 41%, well in excess of single targeted agents in patients with progressive PNETs. Six-month PFS was a notable 79% in a population of patients with disease progression by RECIST criteria within 7 months of study entry. On the basis of this trial, continued evaluation of combination mTOR and VEGF pathway inhibitors is warranted.'

We evaluated choice, duration, and efficacy of subsequent therapy and determined the impact of subsequent-line treatment on outcome of patients in FIRE-3.RESULTS:  Of 592 patients in the intent-to-treat population, 414 (69.9%) received second-line and 256 (43.2%) received third-line therapy. In subsequent treatment lines, 47.1% of patients originally assigned to arm A received bevacizumab, and 52.2% originally assigned to arm B received either cetuximab or panitumumab. Oxaliplatin was subsequently used in 55.9% (arm A) and 53.2% (arm B) of patients. Second-line therapy was administered for a median duration of 5.0 versus 3.2 months (P < .001) in study arm A versus B.

S' The incidence and spectrum of acute toxicities related to the use of bevacizumab (BVZ)-containing regimens in children are largely unknown. This report describes the adverse events in a recently completed large phase 2 trial of BVZ plus irinotecan (CPT-11) in children with recurrent central nervous system tumors.METHODS:  Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium trial-022 evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of BVZ (10 mg/kg administered intravenously) as a single agent for 2 doses given 2 weeks apart and then combined with CPT-11 every 2 weeks (1 course = 4 weeks) in children with recurrent central nervous system tumors. Children were treated until they experienced progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity or completed up to a maximum of 2 years of therapy. Toxicities were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0. Patients who received at least 1 dose of BVZ were included for toxicity assessment.RESULTS:  Between October 2006 and June 2010, 92 patients evaluable for toxicity were enrolled and received 687 treatment courses. The most common toxicities attributable to BVZ included grade I-III hypertension (38% of patients), grade I-III fatigue (30%), grade I-II epistaxis (24%), and grade I-IV proteinuria (22%). Twenty-two patients (24%) stopped therapy due to toxicity.S:  The combination of BVZ and CPT-11 was fairly well-tolerated, and most severe BVZ-related toxicities were rare, self-limiting, and manageable.'

S'The myeloproliferative neoplasm, myelofibrosis, is a morbid and frequently fatal illness encompassing primary myelofibrosis, and end-stage essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia. Bevacizumab (15 mg/kg intravenous (i.v.) every 21 days) was tested in a phase II international trial conducted by the Myeloproliferative Disorders Research Consortium. Thirteen patients were enrolled in the first stage of this 2-stage trial. Among the 11 patients who received therapy, only 3 received more than 4 cycles of therapy; none of the patients achieved an objective response. Furthermore, significant toxicity, not directly related to the vascular or gastrointestinal events typically associated with the anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody preparation in other disease states, was observed. Lack of objective responses coupled with toxicity led to the decision to terminate the study early. If future studies incorporate bevacizumab in combination therapy for myelofibrosis, more modest doses should be considered. (clinicaltrials.gov Identifier 00667277). '

At the end of cycle 2, the changes in relative angiogenic volume were significantly different between responders and nonresponders (P = .001). The major toxicity of this NCT was myelosuppression.: "" NCT with weekly nab-P, carboplatin, and biweekly bevacizumab resulted in a pCR rate that was neither superior to the historical data with anthracycline- or taxane-containing NCT nor to carboplatin and taxane combinations in patients with HER2-negative BC.

Plasma samples (baseline/throughout treatment) were analyzed for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A (baseline only), VEGF receptors (VEGFR-1/VEGFR-2), basic fibroblast growth factor, E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and placental growth factor (baseline only). Tumor samples (primary specimen) were analyzed for VEGF-A, VEGFR-1/VEGFR-2, neuropilin (NRP), and CD31. Response was evaluated at baseline and every 6 weeks (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors).RESULTS:  Patients were randomized to receive chemotherapy plus 7.5 mg/kg (n =154) or 15 mg/kg (n =149) bevacizumab. For the primary analysis, none of the baseline plasma biomarkers correlated with best overall response. Exploratory analyses showed that low VEGF-A levels were associated with longer progression-free survival (7.4 versus 6.1 months; hazard ratio, 1.57; 95% confidence intervals, 1.17 to 2.09; p = 0.002) and overall survival (19.8 versus 11.1 months; hazard ratio, 1.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-2.13; p = 0.004) compared with these in high baseline plasma VEGF-A levels. No plasma biomarkers changed significantly over time. No significant correlations were observed between tumor biomarkers and clinical outcomes. No new safety signals were observed.: "" Baseline and/or dynamic changes in plasma basic fibroblast growth factor, E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, placental growth factor, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, and tumor biomarkers did not correlate statistically with treatment outcomes for bevacizumab plus chemotherapy.

S'Patients with unresectable glioblastomas have a poor prognosis, with median survival of 6-10 months. We conducted a phase II trial of upfront 5-day temozolomide (TMZ) and bevacizumab (BV) in patients with newly diagnosed unresectable or multifocal glioblastoma. Patients received up to four cycles of TMZ at 200 mg/m(2) on days 1-5, and BV at 10 mg/kg on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed monthly. Therapy was continued as long as there was no tumor progression, grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity, or recurrent grade 4 hematologic toxicity after dose reduction. The primary end point was best tumor response as measured on MRI. Forty-one patients were accrued over 12 months; 39 had a full set of MRI scans available for evaluation. Assessment for best radiographic responses was as follows: partial responses in 24.4%, stable disease in 68.3%, and progressive disease in 2.4%. Treatment-related toxicities included seven grade 4 toxicities and one grade 5 toxicity (myocardial infarction). From this study, it was concluded that an upfront regimen of TMZ and BV for unresectable glioblastoma was well tolerated and provided a significant level of disease stabilization. Therapeutic toxicities were consistent with those seen in the adjuvant setting using these agents. The upfront approach to treatment of glioblastoma in the unresectable population warrants further investigation in randomized controlled phase III trials.'

We conducted a phase I study of dasatinib, capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab (CapeOx/bevacizumab), with an expansion cohort in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC).METHODS:  Patients were enrolled in a dose escalation cohort to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). Using a "3\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x893" design, twelve patients with advanced solid tumors received dasatinib (50 mg twice daily or 70 mg daily), capecitabine (850 mg/m(2) twice daily, days 1-14), oxaliplatin (130 mg/m(2) on day 1) and bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg on day1), every 3 weeks. Ten patients with previously untreated metastatic CRC were then enrolled in an expansion cohort. Activated src (src(act)) expression was measured by immunohistochemistry, using an antibody that selectively recognizes the active conformation of src (clone 28).RESULTS:  Twenty-two patients were enrolled between June 2009 and May 2011. Two DLTs were observed in the 50 mg bid dasatinib cohort, and one DLT was observed in the 70 mg daily dasatinib cohort. The MTD and RP2D for dasatinib was 70 mg daily. The most common treatment-related adverse events were fatigue (20; 91 %) and diarrhea (18; 82 %). Biomarker analysis of src(act) expression demonstrated that the overall response rate (ORR) was 75 % (6/8) for patients with high src(act) expression (IHC\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa5\xe2\x80\x892), compared to 0 % (0/8) for patients with low srcact expression (IHC 0 or 1); (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.007).S:  The RP2D of dasatinib is 70 mg daily in combination with CapeOx/bevacizumab.

S' A fluoropyrimidine plus irinotecan or oxaliplatin, combined with bevacizumab (a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor), is standard first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer. Before the introduction of bevacizumab, chemotherapy with fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan (FOLFOXIRI) showed superior efficacy as compared with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI). In a phase 2 study, FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab showed promising activity and an acceptable rate of adverse effects.METHODS:  We randomly assigned 508 patients with untreated metastatic colorectal cancer to receive either FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab (control group) or FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab (experimental group). Up to 12 cycles of treatment were administered, followed by fluorouracil plus bevacizumab until disease progression. The primary end point was progression-free survival.RESULTS:  The median progression-free survival was 12.1 months in the experimental group, as compared with 9.7 months in the control group (hazard ratio for progression, 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62 to 0.90; P=0.003). The objective response rate was 65% in the experimental group and 53% in the control group (P=0.006). Overall survival was longer, but not significantly so, in the experimental group (31.0 vs. 25.8 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.00; P=0.054). The incidences of grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity, stomatitis, diarrhea, and neutropenia were significantly higher in the experimental group.'

Nab-paclitaxel has demonstrated improved PFS and tolerability compared with standard cremophor-solubilized paclitaxel; based on this, we examined the efficacy and safety of combining weekly nab-paclitaxel with carboplatin and bevacizumab in TNMBC.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  In this phase II, multicenter trial, patients with first-line TNMBC received nab-paclitaxel (100 mg/m(2)) and carboplatin (area under the curve\xc2\xa0= 2) on days 1, 8, 15, and bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle. The primary end point was safety and tolerability and secondary end points included PFS, ORR, and CBR. PFS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS:  Between July 16, 2007, and October 3, 2011, 34 patients were enrolled at 4 centers. Median age was 50.0 (range, 30-76) years and 77% (n = 26) of patients received previous adjuvant therapy. Median PFS was 9.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.8-25.1 months). The CBR was 94% (95% CI, 80%-99%), and ORR was 85% (95% CI, 69%-95%) for the combination.

S' This clinical trial evaluated whether topotecan in combination with bevacizumab improved progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced, refractory non--small-cell lung cancer in a second-line setting.PATIENT AND METHODS: "PATIENT AND METHODS" Patients aged 18 years old and older received topotecan (4.0 mg/m(2)) on days 1, 8, and 15, and bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) on days 1 and 15 as intravenous infusions on a 28-day treatment cycle. Available tumor specimens were analyzed for ISG15 gene expression as a biomarker of response to topotecan.RESULTS:  Forty-two patients were enrolled in the study, with a median age of 62.5 years and a median of 3 (range, 1-7) prior treatment regimens. Almost half (n = 18, 42.9%) of the patients received prior bevacizumab therapy. PFS was 5.1 months (95% CI, 3.7-7.8 months), and overall survival was 11.5 months (95% CI, 6.8-15.5 months). Response rates were as follows: 14.3% partial response, 54.8% stable disease, and 28.6% progressive disease. Hematologic toxicities included grade 3 thrombocytopenia (n = 7, 16.7%), neutropenia (n = 4, 9.5%), and anemia (n = 2, 4.8%). One toxic death occurred due to pulmonary hemorrhage, and one patient experienced a grade 4 pulmonary embolism. Grade 3 nonhematologic adverse events were uncommon (< 8%). There was a trend for improved median PFS, 3.5 months vs. 1.8 months (P = .26), in patients with high ISG15 expression.: "" Bevacizumab in combination with topotecan as a salvage therapy for metastatic non--small-cell lung cancer is well tolerated and is worthy of further investigation.'

S'The aim of this phase II trial was to estimate the objective response rate (ORR) of two different schedules of ixabepilone [weekly or every 3 weeks (Q3W)] combined with bevacizumab, relative to a reference arm of weekly paclitaxel and bevacizumab. Patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-normal, chemotherapy-na\xc3\xafve metastatic breast cancer (MBC) were randomized 3:3:2 to ixabepilone 16 mg/m(2) weekly plus bevacizumab 10 mg/kg Q2W (Arm A: n = 46); ixabepilone 40 mg/m(2) Q3W (reduced to 32 mg/m(2) after four cycles of treatment) plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg Q3W (Arm B: n = 45); or paclitaxel 90 mg/m(2) weekly plus bevacizumab 10 mg/kg intravenous infusion Q2W (Arm C: n = 32). Of 123 randomized patients, 122 were treated. All were followed for \xe2\x89\xa519 months; 5 % of patients remained on study treatment at the time of this analysis. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was more common in Arm B (60 %) than Arms A (16 %) or C (22 %); other adverse events were similar. The investigator-assessed ORR was 48, 71, and 63 % for Arms A, B, and C, respectively. Median progression-free survival (randomized patients) was 9.6 months in Arm A, 11.9 months in Arm B, and 13.5 months in Arm C. In conclusion, ixabepilone Q3W plus bevacizumab has clinical activity as first-line therapy for MBC relative to paclitaxel plus bevacizumab, but with significantly greater risk of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. In addition, these data suggest that weekly dosing of ixabepilone may be less active than Q3W dosing, but with less neutropenia.'

We conducted a phase II trial of upfront therapy with bevacizumab (BV), irinotecan (CPT-11), and temozolomide (TMZ) prior to chemoradiation in patients with unresectable, subtotally resected, and/or multifocal GBM.METHODS:  Patients received up to 4 cycles of TMZ at 200 mg/m(2) per day on days 1-5 (standard dosing) and BV at 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks on a 28-day cycle. CPT-11 was given every 2 weeks on a 28-day cycle at 125 mg/m(2) or 340 mg/m(2) depending on antiepileptic drugs. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was done every 4 weeks, and treatment continued as long as there was no tumor progression or unmanageable toxicity. The primary endpoint was tumor response rate, with a goal of 26% or greater.RESULTS:  Forty-one patients were enrolled from December 2009 to November 2010. Radiographic responses were as follows: 9 patients (22.0%) had partial response, 25 (61.0%) had stable disease, and 2 (4.9%) had progression; 5 patients were not assessed. Cumulative response rate was 22%.

S' Sunitinib treatment results in a compensatory increase in plasma VEGF levels. Acute withdrawal of sunitinib results in a proliferative withdrawal flare, primarily due to elevated VEGF levels. Concurrent sunitinib plus bevacizumab is poorly tolerated with high (37 %) incidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA). We evaluated a sequential design administering bevacizumab during the sunitinib treatment break to suppress the sunitinib withdrawal flare.METHODS:  Patients with no prior VEGF treatment were enrolled in this study. All patients had target lesions amenable to serial FLT PET/CT imaging. Sunitinib 37.5 mg was given on days 1-28 every 6 weeks with bevacizumab 5 mg/kg on day 29. If safe and tolerable, sunitinib increased to 50 mg. FLT PET/CT scans would be obtained at baseline (D1), week 4, and week 6 to evaluate pharmacodynamics of the sequential combination. Sunitinib pharmacokinetics and total, free, and bound VEGF levels were obtained on each cycle at D1, pre-bevacizumab (D29), 4 h post-bevacizumab (D29H4), and day 42 (D42).RESULTS:  Six patients enrolled in the safety cohort of sunitinib 37.5 mg plus bevacizumab (see Table). One patient experienced grade 1 MAHA, and after discussion with the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), the trial was closed to further accrual. No imaging scans were obtained due to early closure.

As predicted, VEGF levels increased during sunitinib exposure followed by a rapid decline after bevacizumab. Due to the long half-life of bevacizumab, we expected VEGF ligand suppression through D42, but instead observed a complete rebound in total/free VEGF levels by D42. The increase in VEGF at D42 was unexpected based on sunitinib alone and contrary to the hypothesis that we would block VEGF flare with low-dose bevacizumab. VEGF ligand production may increase as a result of bevacizumab, implying a robust host compensatory mechanism to VEGF signaling pathway inhibition. A greater understanding of the compensatory mechanism would aid future sequencing strategies of new agents.'

Predicted Cp [median and 90% prediction interval] was simulated using the population pharmacokinetic model established for other cancers (PPK model) and compared to observed Cp. Bevacizumab clearance was estimated using NONMEM and compared between subgroups. Patient characteristics of AGC are similar to other cancers except for lower body weight despite higher percentage of males. Eighty-five percent of observed Cp was below the median predicted Cp and 38% below the lower boundary of the 90% prediction interval. Median bevacizumab clearance in AGC was 4.5 versus 3 mL/day/kg in other cancers. Bevacizumab clearance was significantly faster (p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05) in patients without gastrectomy (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8942) or lower albumin. Clearance appeared to be faster in patients with lower total protein, higher ECOG scores, more metastatic sites, and poorer response. No significant difference in bevacizumab concentrations and clearance was observed between Asian and Non-Asian patients. AGC patients exhibited significantly lower bevacizumab exposure due to an approximate 50% increase in clearance versus other cancers. Bevacizumab is cleared faster in patients without prior gastrectomy. No significant difference in bevacizumab pharmacokinetics was observed between Asian and Non-Asian patients. The underlying mechanism for faster bevacizumab clearance in AGC is unknown and warrants further research.'

S' To prospectively determine the efficacy of combination therapy with temsirolimus plus bevacizumab versus interferon alfa (IFN) plus bevacizumab in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).PATIENTS AND METHODS:  In a randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase III study, patients with previously untreated predominantly clear-cell mRCC were randomly assigned, stratified by prior nephrectomy and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center prognostic group, to receive the combination of either temsirolimus (25 mg intravenously, weekly) or IFN (9 MIU subcutaneously thrice weekly) with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg intravenously, every 2 weeks). The primary end point was independently assessed progression-free survival (PFS).RESULTS:  Median PFS in patients treated with temsirolimus/bevacizumab (n = 400) versus IFN/bevacizumab (n = 391) was 9.1 and 9.3 months, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9 to 1.3; P = .8). There were no significant differences in overall survival (25.8 \xce\xbd 25.5 months; HR, 1.0; P = .6) or objective response rate (27.0% \xce\xbd 27.4%) with temsirolimus/bevacizumab versus IFN/bevacizumab, respectively. Patients receiving temsirolimus/bevacizumab reported significantly higher overall mean scores in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Kidney Symptom Index (FKSI) -15 and FKSI-Disease Related Symptoms subscale compared with IFN/bevacizumab (indicating improvement); however, no differences in global health outcome measures were observed. Treatment-emergent all-causality grade \xe2\x89\xa5 3 adverse events more common (P < .001) with temsirolimus/bevacizumab were mucosal inflammation, stomatitis, hypophosphatemia, hyperglycemia, and hypercholesterolemia, whereas neutropenia was more common with IFN/bevacizumab. Incidence of pneumonitis with temsirolimus/bevacizumab was 4.8%, mostly grade 1 or 2.: "" Temsirolimus/bevacizumab combination therapy was not superior to IFN/bevacizumab for first-line treatment in clear-cell mRCC.'

S' Brain metastases (BMs) are associated with a poor prognosis. Standard treatment comprises whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT). As neo-angiogenesis is crucial in BM growth, combining angiogenesis inhibitors such as bevacizumab with radiotherapy is of interest. We aimed to identify the optimal regimen of bevacizumab combined with WBRT for BM for phase II evaluation and provide preliminary efficacy data.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  In this multicentre single-arm phase I study with a 3 + 3 dose-escalation design, patients with unresectable BM from solid tumours received three cycles of bevacizumab at escalating doses [5, 10 and 15 mg/kg every 2 weeks at dose levels (DL) 0, 1 and 2, respectively] and WBRT (30 Gy/15 fractions/3 weeks) administered from day 15. DL3 consisted of bevacizumab 15 mg/kg with WBRT from day 15 in 30 Gy/10 fractions/2 weeks. Safety was evaluated using NCI-CTCAE version 3. BM response (RECIST 1.1) was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging at 6 weeks and 3 months after WBRT.RESULTS:  Nineteen patients were treated, of whom 13 had breast cancer. There were no DLTs. Grade 1-2 in-field and out-field toxicities occurred for five and nine patients across all DLs, respectively, including three and six patients (including one patient with both, so eight patients overall) of nine patients in DL3. One patient experienced BM progression during treatment (DL0). At the 3-month post-treatment assessment, 10 patients showed a BM response: one of three treated at DL0, one of three at DL1, two of three at DL2 and six of seven at DL3, including one complete response. BM progression occurred in five patients, resulting in two deaths. The remaining patient died from extracranial disease progression.: "" Bevacizumab combined with WBRT appears to be a tolerable treatment of BM. DL3 warrants further efficacy evaluation based on the favourable safety/efficacy balance.'

The primary endpoint was 12-month progression-free survival (PFS).RESULTS:  A total of 132 patients (80 with measurable disease at baseline; 52 with non-measurable, evaluable disease at baseline) enrolled and received study treatment. At diagnosis, 76.5% of patients had stage III disease and 20% had stage IV. 62.9% were optimally cytoreduced. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia (42.4%), leukopenia (13.6%), hypertension (8.3%), fatigue (6.1%), and nausea (6.1%). One patient (0.8%) had a fatal gastrointestinal perforation. The best overall confirmed response rate (complete response+partial response [measurable disease subgroup]) was 58.6% (95% CI 49%, 67%).

S' Whether bevacizumab enhances the effect of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor gefitinib on EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) remains unknown. We conducted a phase II trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of gefitinib when combined with bevacizumab as first-line therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR gene mutations.METHODS:  In this trial, 42 patients with a performance status of 0 to 2 received gefitinib (250 mg/d) and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg, every 3 weeks). The primary end point of this study was the 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate. We assumed that a 1-year PFS rate of 55% would indicate potential usefulness and that a 1-year PFS rate of 40% would constitute the lower limit of interest.RESULTS:  Forty-two patients were enrolled in the study with a median age of 73 (range 42-86) years. Activating EGFR gene mutations included exon 19 deletion (57%) and L858R point mutations in exon 21 (38%). The objective response rate was 73.8% and included two complete responses. The 1-year PFS rate and median PFS time were 56.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 39.9-70.5) and 14.4 months (95% CI 10.1-19.2), respectively. The median PFS differed significantly between EGFR exon 19 deletion and the L858R point mutation (18.0 versus 9.4 months, respectively; p = 0.006). The median overall survival had not yet been reached. Severe adverse events included grade 3 skin rash (15%), hypertension (17%), aspartate transaminase/alanine aminotransferase elevation (17%), proteinuria (7%), intracranial hemorrhage (2%), and grade 4 perforation of the digestive tract (2%). There were no treatment-related deaths.: "" Gefitinib in combination with bevacizumab as first-line therapy seems to be a favorable and well-tolerated treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC with activating EGFR gene mutations, especially those with EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations, although the primary end point was not met because the lower limit of the CI was less than 40%.'

S'"EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN" Patients with stage IV nonsquamous NSCLC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1, and untreated, asymptomatic brain metastases received first-line bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) plus carboplatin (area under the curve \xc3\x976) and paclitaxel (200 mg/m(2)) every 3 weeks (B + CP), or second-line bevacizumab plus erlotinib (150 mg/d; B + E). Six-month progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint. The trial could be stopped if there were more than three (B + CP) or more than two (B + E) intracranial hemorrhages.RESULTS:  In first-line B + CP cohort (n = 67), 6-month PFS rate was 56.5% with a median PFS of 6.7 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 5.7-7.1] and median overall survival (OS) of 16.0 months. Investigator-assessed overall response rate (ORR) was 62.7%: 61.2% in intracranial lesions and 64.2% in extracranial lesions. Because of low enrolment (n = 24), efficacy results for the second-line B + E cohort were exploratory only; 6-month PFS rate was 57.2%, median PFS was 6.3 months (95% CI, 3.0-8.4), median OS was 12.0 months, and ORR was 12.5%. Adverse events were comparable with previous trials of bevacizumab. One grade 1 intracranial hemorrhage occurred and resolved without sequelae.S:  The BRAIN study demonstrates encouraging efficacy and acceptable safety of bevacizumab with first-line paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with NSCLC and asymptomatic, untreated brain metastases.'

S' This phase I study was performed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended dose (RD), and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of oxaliplatin combined with preoperative chemoradiotherapy with S-1, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab in locally advanced rectal cancer.METHODS:  Eligible patients had a newly diagnosed clinical stage T1-4 N0-3 M0 rectal adenocarcinoma within 12 cm of the anal verge suitable for curative resection. Conformal radiation therapy was given (4 fields, 2 Gy daily fractions, 5 days/week, total dose 40 Gy) with concurrent S-1 (80 mg/m(2)/day orally, days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, and 22-26), bevacizumab (90 min continuous intravenous infusion at 5 mg/kg, days 1 and 15), and oxaliplatin (120 min continuous intravenous infusion, days 1, 8, 15, and 22). The initial oxaliplatin dose (40 mg/m(2)/day) was gradually increased to determine the MTD and RD. Surgery was performed 6 weeks after completion of preoperative chemoradiotherapy.RESULTS:  11 patients were enrolled. The MTD of oxaliplatin was considered to be 60 mg/m(2), because three of five patients developed DLTs such as diarrhea and hives. The recommended dose of oxaliplatin was set at 50 mg/m(2). Of the patients who received oxaliplatin at \xe2\x89\xa4 RD, 5 (83.3%) had a clinical response [four pathological responses and one pathological complete response (Grade 3)].S:  With this new regimen, the MTD of oxaliplatin was 60 mg/m(2), and the RD for phase II studies was 50 mg/m(2). This new regimen appears to provide worthwhile outcomes for locally advanced rectal cancer and merits a phase II study.'

S' Optimization of chemotherapy effectiveness in metastatic colorectal cancers (mCRC) is a major endpoint to enhance the possibility of curative intent surgery. FOLFIRI3 has shown promising results as second-line chemotherapy for mCRC patients previously exposed to oxaliplatin. The clinical efficacy of FOLFIRI3 was never determined in association with bevacizumab in non-previously treated mCRC patients.METHODS:  We conducted a phase II clinical trial to characterize the response rate and toxicity profile of FOLFIRI3-bevacizumab as initial treatment for mCRC. Sixty-one patients enrolled in 3 investigation centers were treated with FOLFIRI3-bevacizumab (median of 10\xc2\xa0cycles) followed by a maintenance therapy combining bevacizumab and capecitabine. Levels of plasma angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at baseline.RESULTS:  Overall response rate (ORR) was 66.7% (8% of complete and 58% of partial responses). The disease control rate was 91.7%. After a median time of follow-up of 46.7\xc2\xa0months, 56 patients (92%) had progressed or died. The median progression free survival (PFS) was 12.7\xc2\xa0months (95% confidence interval (CI) 9.7-15.8\xc2\xa0months). The median overall survival (OS) was 24.5\xc2\xa0months (95% CI: 10.6-38.3\xc2\xa0months). Twenty-one patients underwent curative intent-surgery including 4 patients with disease initially classified as unresectable. Most common grade III-IV toxicities were diarrhea (15%), neutropenia (13%), asthenia (10%), and infections (4%). Hypertension-related medications needed to be increased in 3 patients. In multivariate analysis, surgery of metastases and Ang-2 levels were the only independent prognostic factors for PFS and OS. Indeed, baseline level of Ang-2 above 5\xc2\xa0ng/mL was confirmed as an independent prognostic factor for progression free survival (HR\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.357; 95% CI: 0.168-0.76, p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.005) and overall survival (HR\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.226; 95% CI: 0.098-0.53, p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.0002).S:  As front-line therapy, FOLFIRI-3-bevacizumab is associated with an acceptable toxicity and induced promising objective response rates. However, unfavorable clinical outcomes were observed in patients with high levels of angiopoietin-2.'

S'"INTRODUCTION" Bevacizumab improves outcome for patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) when added to chemotherapy. The HORIZON I trial resulted in similar outcome with bevacizumab or cediranib, a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor, as treatment of advanced CRC. The spectrum of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isoenzyme expression was examined in serum samples of HORIZON I participants to identify biomarkers predictive of efficacy of VEGF pathway inhibitors.: "" Total LDH levels, as well as LDH isoenzyme levels in frozen baseline serum samples, were retrospectively evaluated. Total LDH serum levels measured during the study, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were available from the HORIZON I study data.RESULTS:  Total LDH levels measured in the frozen serum samples correlated with those measured in fresh samples. The expected reciprocal correlation was found between hypoxic and oxic LDH isoenzymes. High total LDH correlated with shorter PFS, and high hypoxia-related LDH isoenzymes correlated with shorter PFS and OS. The difference in outcome of the cediranib-treated patients vs. those treated with bevacizumab was not substantially different in the various LDH isoform expression subgroups. In patients with a hypoxic LDH pattern of expression, there was a nonsignificant trend of better outcome in cediranib-treated patients.: "" Evaluation of total LDH and its isoforms in frozen serum samples is feasible. High total LDH and high hypoxic LDH isoenzymes were associated with poor prognosis. Further studies are needed to evaluate the predictive value of LDH isoenzyme expression pattern for VEGF-pathway inhibition efficacy.'

S' To evaluate the clinical outcome(s) and complication(s) of subconjunctival bevacizumab treatment in patients with recurrent pterygium.METHODS:  This prospective case series included patients who had undergone pterygium surgery and were diagnosed with recurrent pterygium. All patients received one subconjunctival injection of 0.5 mL of bevacizumab (2.5 mg/0.1 mL). The main outcome was the change in size and clinical appearance. The clinical appearance of the pterygium was graded according to Tan and colleagues. The horizontal size of the pterygium (from limbus to apex) was recorded from baseline to 2 months after injection. Treatment-related complications and adverse events were reported.RESULTS:  We included 36 eyes of 36 patients (18 males) with a mean age of 58.75 \xc2\xb1 10.98 years. Totally, 30.6% patients developed recurrent pterygium in both eyes (only the worst eye was treated), with 47.2% developing it in the left eye and 22.2% in the right eye. More than half the patients (58.3%) had a family history of pterygium. There was a significant difference in the size of pterygium at different intervals (P<0.05). Approximately two-thirds (66.7%) of patients presented with hyposphagma on the 2nd day after subconjunctival application; this value decreased to 30.6% by day 7 and to 0% at 1 month. Most patients (69.4%) exhibited amelioration of irritative symptoms within 2 days, 88.9% after 7 days, and 97.2% after 1 month.S:  Subconjunctival bevacizumab injection is useful for the management of patients with recurrent pterygium, with no significant local or systemic adverse effects.'

S' The goal of this phase 1 trial was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of concurrent capecitabine, bevacizumab, and erlotinib with preoperative radiation therapy for rectal cancer.: "" Patients with clinical stage II to III rectal adenocarcinoma, within 12 cm from the anal verge, were treated in 4 escalating dose levels, using the continual reassessment method. Patients received preoperative radiation therapy with concurrent bevacizumab (5 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks), erlotinib, and capecitabine. Capecitabine dose was increased from 650 mg/m(2) to 825 mg/m(2) orally twice daily on the days of radiation therapy; erlotinib dose was increased from 50 mg orally daily in weeks 1 to 3, to 50 mg daily in weeks 1 to 6, to 100 mg daily in weeks 1 to 6. Patients underwent surgery at least 9 weeks after the last dose of bevacizumab.RESULTS:  A total of 19 patients were enrolled, and 18 patients were considered evaluable. No patient had grade 4 acute toxicity, and 1 patient had grade 3 acute toxicity (hypertension). The MTD was not reached. All 18 evaluable patients underwent surgery, with low anterior resection in 7 (39%), proctectomy with coloanal anastomosis in 4 patients (22%), posterior pelvic exenteration in 1 (6%), and abdominoperineal resection in 6 (33%). Of the 18 patients, 8 (44%) had pathologic complete response, and 1 had complete response of the primary tumor with positive nodes. Three patients (17%) had grade 3 postoperative complications (ileus, small bowel obstruction, and infection). With a median follow-up of 34 months, 1 patient developed distant metastasis, and no patient had local recurrence or died. The 3-year disease-free survival was 94%.S:  The combination of preoperative radiation therapy with concurrent capecitabine, bevacizumab, and erlotinib was well tolerated.

S' The addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy improves progression-free survival in metastatic breast cancer and pathological complete response rates in the neoadjuvant setting. Micrometastases are dependent on angiogenesis, suggesting that patients might benefit from anti-angiogenic strategies in the adjuvant setting. We therefore assessed the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting for women with triple-negative breast cancer.METHODS: For this open-label, randomised phase 3 trial we recruited patients with centrally confirmed triple-negative operable primary invasive breast cancer from 360 sites in 37 countries. We randomly allocated patients aged 18 years or older (1:1 with block randomisation; stratified by nodal status, chemotherapy [with an anthracycline, taxane, or both], hormone receptor status [negative vs low], and type of surgery) to receive a minimum of four cycles of chemotherapy either alone or with bevacizumab (equivalent of 5 mg/kg every week for 1 year). The primary endpoint was invasive disease-free survival (IDFS). Efficacy analyses were based on the intention-to-treat population, safety analyses were done on all patients who received at least one dose of study drug, and plasma biomarker analyses were done on all treated patients consenting to biomarker analyses and providing a measurable baseline plasma sample. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00528567" title="See in ClincalTrials.gov"NCT00528567</a.FINDINGS: "FINDINGS" Between Dec 3, 2007, and March 8, 2010, we randomly assigned 1290 patients to receive chemotherapy alone and 1301 to receive bevacizumab plus chemotherapy. Most patients received anthracycline-containing therapy; 1638 (63%) of the 2591 patients had node-negative disease. At the time of analysis of IDFS, median follow-up was 31\xc2\xb75 months (IQR 25\xc2\xb76-36\xc2\xb78) in the chemotherapy-alone group and 32\xc2\xb70 months (27\xc2\xb75-36\xc2\xb79) in the bevacizumab group. At the time of the primary analysis, IDFS events had been reported in 205 patients (16%) in the chemotherapy-alone group and in 188 patients (14%) in the bevacizumab group (hazard ratio [HR] in stratified log-rank analysis 0\xc2\xb787, 95% CI 0\xc2\xb772-1\xc2\xb707; p=0\xc2\xb718). 3-year IDFS was 82\xc2\xb77% (95% CI 80\xc2\xb75-85\xc2\xb70) with chemotherapy alone and 83\xc2\xb77% (81\xc2\xb74-86\xc2\xb70) with bevacizumab and chemotherapy. After 200 deaths, no difference in overall survival was noted between the groups (HR 0\xc2\xb784, 95% CI 0\xc2\xb764-1\xc2\xb712; p=0\xc2\xb723). Exploratory biomarker assessment suggests that patients with high pre-treatment plasma VEGFR-2 might benefit from the addition of bevacizumab (Cox interaction test p=0\xc2\xb7029). Use of bevacizumab versus chemotherapy alone was associated with increased incidences of grade 3 or worse hypertension (154 patients [12%] vs eight patients [1%]), severe cardiac events occurring at any point during the 18-month safety reporting period (19 [1%] vs two [<0\xc2\xb75%]), and treatment discontinuation (bevacizumab, chemotherapy, or both; 256 [20%] vs 30 [2%]); we recorded no increase in fatal adverse events with bevacizumab (four [<0\xc2\xb75%] vs three [<0\xc2\xb75%]).INTERPRETATION: "INTERPRETATION" Bevacizumab cannot be recommended as adjuvant treatment in unselected patients with triple-negative breast cancer. Further follow-up is needed to assess the potential effect of bevacizumab on overall survival.'

S'A combination of oxaliplatin, leucovorin and 5-fluorouracil (FOLFOX) plus bevacizumab has been widely used for the first-line chemotherapy of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). S-1 is an oral fluoropyrimidine preparation that combines tegafur, a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil, with two modulators. Several studies of combination chemotherapy with oxaliplatin plus S-1 (SOX) conducted in Asia have reported promising efficacy and safety in patients with mCRC, suggesting the potential to replace mFOLFOX6. The SOFT trial (JapicCTI-090699) was a randomized Phase III trial designed to evaluate the noninferiority of SOX plus bevacizumab to mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab in patients with mCRC.

This phase II study tested the efficacy and safety of a biweekly gemcitabine, carboplatin, and bevacizumab combination in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian, peritoneal, or tubal cancer (ROC).PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Eligible patients received concurrent gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2), carboplatin area under the curve 3, and bevacizumab 10 mg/kg administered intravenously on days 1 and 15 every 28 days for six cycles or up to 24 cycles if clinical benefit occurred. The primary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) by RECIST, and safety; the secondary end points were objective response rates and overall survival.RESULTS:  Overall, 45 patients were enrolled. The median PFS was 13.3 months (95% CI, 11.3 to 15.3). The objective response rate was 69%. Grade 4 hematologic toxicities included neutropenia (27%) and thrombocytopenia (2%). Grades 3 and 4 non-hematologic toxicities included fatigue (18%), pain (9%), and nausea/vomiting (4%). There were 2 episodes of cerebrovascular accidents, 2 noted DVTs, and no episodes of bowel perforation. Median OS was 36.1 months (95% CI, 26.7 to 45.5).: "" Biweekly gemcitabine, carboplatin, and bevacizumab were an effective regimen in recurrent ovarian cancer, with comparable toxicity to recently reported day 1 gemcitabine, carboplatin, bevacizumab, and day 8 gemcitabine. Response rate and PFS are improved from reported outcomes of the gemcitabine carboplatin doublet. The degree to which biweekly dosing may present a more rationale schedule for this triplet should be evaluated further.'

Stage IIIB/IV patients with NS-NSCLC were randomised on erlotinib (150\xe2\x80\x85mg daily) and bevacizumab (15\xe2\x80\x85mg\xc2\xb7kg(-1) on day 1, every 3\xe2\x80\x85weeks) (EB) until progression, or cisplatin (80\xe2\x80\x85mg\xc2\xb7m(-2) on day 1, every 3\xe2\x80\x85weeks) and gemcitabine (1250\xe2\x80\x85mg\xc2\xb7m(-2) on days 1 and 8, every 3\xe2\x80\x85weeks) up to six cycles and bevacizumab (15\xe2\x80\x85mg\xc2\xb7kg(-1) on day 1, every 3\xe2\x80\x85weeks) (PGB) until progression. 224 patients were randomised (EB n=111, PGB n=113). The response rate (12% versus 36%; p<0.0001), progression-free survival (median 3.5 versus 6.9\xe2\x80\x85months; hazard ratio (HR) 1.85, 95% CI 1.39-2.45; p<0.0001) and overall survival (median 12.6 versus 17.8\xe2\x80\x85months; HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.01-1.97; p=0.04) clearly favoured PGB. In patients with epidermal growth factor receptor mutations (n=32), response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival were not superior with EB. Platinum-based combination chemotherapy remains the standard of care in first-line treatment of unselected NS-NSCLC. Molecular targeted approaches strongly mandate appropriate testing and patient selection.'

S' Bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy has recently shown promising efficacy in recurrent high-grade glioma. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) mutation in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients causes abnormally high activity of the pathways of Phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3K), Protein Kinase B (AKT), and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and is associated with unfavorable prognosis. Temsirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, has been well-tolerated in monotherapy, but with limited effects. The combination of temsirolimus and antibodies to vascular endothelial factor (VEGF) has not yet been investigated, but with the hypothesis that temsirolimus might provide complimentary therapeutic benefit in combination with bevacizumab, we included patients with progressive GBM after bevacizumab in an open phase II study.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Adult patients with GBM recurrence after standard temozolomide chemoradiotherapy and bevacizumab-containing second-line therapy, received temsirolimus (25 mg i.v.) on days 1 and 8 and bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) on day 8, every two weeks. Assessments were performed every eight weeks. Blood samples for biomarkers were collected weekly for the first eight weeks and at progression. The primary end-point was median progression-free survival (PFS) and secondary end-points were radiographic response, overall survival (OS), and safety of the bevacizumab-temsirolimus combination.RESULTS:  Thirteen patients were included, whereof three went off-study during the first four weeks and were replaced. The trial was terminated at 13 patients, according to the planned two-stage design, because 0/10 patients obtained partial remission (PR). Two out of 10 patients obtained radiological stable disease (SD). The median PFS survival was eight weeks, and OS was 15 weeks. One patient had an serious adverse event (SAE) with a hypersensitive reaction to temsirolimus; overall, side-effects were mild, and the most common grade III side-effect was hypercholesterolaemia (4/10). Other grade III side-effects included hypertriglyceridaemia (1/10), thrombocytopenia (1/10), infection (1/10), hypertension (1/10), and hyperglycemia (1/10).: "" Temsirolimus can be safely administered in combination with bevacizumab. This study failed to detect activity of such a combination in patients with progressive GBM beyond bevacizumab therapy.'

S' Eighty percent of patients with resected pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDC) experience treatment failure within 2 years. We hypothesized that preoperative fixed-dose rate (FDR) gemcitabine (GEM) combined with the angiogenesis inhibitor bevacizumab (BEV) and accelerated 30 Gy radiotherapy (RT) would improve outcomes among patients with potentially resectable PDC.METHODS:  This phase II trial tested induction FDR GEM (1,500 mg/m(2)) plus BEV (10 mg/kg IV) every 2 weeks for three cycles followed by accelerated RT (30 Gy in 10 fractions) plus BEV directed at gross tumor volume plus a 1-2 cm vascular margin. Subjects underwent laparoscopy and resection after day 85. Therapy was considered effective if the complete pathologic response rate exceeded 10 % and the margin-negative resection rate exceeded 80%.RESULTS:  Fifty-nine subjects were enrolled; 29 had potential portal vein involvement. Two grade 4 (3.4%) and 19 grade 3 toxicities (32.8%) occurred. Four subjects manifested radiographic progression, and 10 had undetected carcinomatosis. Forty-three pancreatic resections (73%) were performed, including 19 portal vein resections (44%). Margin-negative outcomes were observed in 38 (88%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 75-96), with one complete pathologic response (2.3%; 95% CI 0.1-12). There were seven (6 grade 3; 1 grade 4) wound complications (13%). Median overall survival for the entire cohort was 16.8 months (95% CI 14.9-21.3) and 19.7 months (95% CI 16.5-28.2) after resection.S:  Induction therapy with FDR GEM and BEV, followed by accelerated BEV/RT to 30 Gy, was well tolerated. Although both effectiveness criteria were achieved, survival outcomes were equivalent to published regimens.'

S'"S" This study aimed to assess the antitumor activity of everolimus and bevacizumab among patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors and to assess perfusion computed tomography (CT) as a potential functional biomarker.METHODS:  Patients with low- to intermediate-grade neuroendocrine tumors received one 3-week cycle of 15 mg/kg of bevacizumab on day 1 or 10 mg of everolimus daily. Subsequent cycles consisted of the combination of both drugs. Perfusion CTs were performed at baseline and at the end of cycles 1 and 3.RESULTS:  Therapy decreased blood flow (BF) proportional to baseline measurements. Bevacizumab was associated with a 44% decrease in BF (P < 0.0001). After the addition of everolimus, a further 29% decrease (P = 0.02) in BF was observed. Everolimus alone was associated with 13% increase in mean transit time (P = 0.02). Clinical activity was demonstrated, with a confirmed response rate of 21% and a median progression-free survival of 14.6 (95% confidence interval, 13.0-16.1) months. Pretreatment tumor permeability surface (P = 0.009), posttreatment mean transit time (P = 0.003), percent reduction in BF (P = 0.03), and percent reduction in blood volume (P = 0.002) were associated with best percent reduction in tumor diameters.S:  Bevacizumab and everolimus demonstrated antitumor activity. Perfusion CT is a promising tool for the development of antiangiogenic strategies and for the selection of patients who are likely to benefit from therapy.'

S' In the AVAGAST study, fluoropyrimidine and cisplatin plus bevacizumab did not significantly improve overall survival (OS) versus fluoropyrimidine and cisplatin plus placebo in patients with advanced gastric cancer. Geographic differences in efficacy were observed in AVAGAST, but the study only included 12 Chinese patients. AVATAR, a study similar in design to AVAGAST, was a randomized, double-blind, phase III study conducted in Chinese patients with advanced gastric cancer.METHODS:  Patients more than 18 years of age with gastric adenocarcinoma were randomized 1:1 to capecitabine-cisplatin plus either bevacizumab or placebo. The primary endpoint was OS; secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and safety.RESULTS:  In total, 202 patients were included (placebo n = 102; bevacizumab n = 100). Baseline characteristics were well balanced. The primary analysis result did not show a difference in OS for the bevacizumab arm compared to the placebo arm [hazard ratio, 1.11 (95% CI, 0.79-1.56); P = 0.5567]. Median PFS was also similar in both arms. Bevacizumab plus capecitabine-cisplatin was well tolerated. Grade 3-5 adverse events (AEs) occurred in 60% of bevacizumab-treated and 68% of placebo-treated patients, respectively. Grade 3-5 AEs of special interest with bevacizumab occurred in 8% of bevacizumab-treated patients and 15% of placebo-treated patients, mainly grade 3-5 hemorrhage (bevacizumab 4%, placebo 12%).S:  Addition of bevacizumab to capecitabine-cisplatin in Chinese patients with advanced gastric cancer did not improve outcomes in AVATAR. There was no difference in OS between the two arms and PFS was similar in both arms.

S' Pre-clinical findings suggest that combination treatment with bevacizumab and temsirolimus could be effective against malignant pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Six pediatric patients were treated as part of a phase I trial with intravenous temsirolimus 25 mg on days 1, 8, 15, and bevacizumab at 5, 10, or 15 mg/kg on day 1 of each 21-day cycle until disease progression or patient withdrawal.RESULTS:  The median patient age was six years (range=3-14 years). The primary diagnoses were glioblastoma multiforme (n=2), medullobalstoma (n=2), pontine glioma (n=1) and ependymoma (n=1). All patients had disease refractory to standard-of-care (2-3 prior systemic therapies). Grade 3 toxicities possibly related to drugs used occurred in two patients: anorexia, nausea, and weight loss in one, and thrombocytopenia and alanine aminotransferase elevation in another. One patient with glioblastoma multiforme achieved a partial response (51% regression) and two patients (with medulloblastoma and pontine glioma) had stable disease for four months or more (20 and 47 weeks, respectively).

S' Chemotherapeutic regimens for elderly patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), such as bevacizumab combined with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin, often exclude oxaliplatin and irinotecan owing to the risk of toxicity. However, treatment with infusional 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin requires percutaneous port-catheter placement and other precautions, causing unnecessary stress for patients as well as healthcare workers.METHODS:  We conducted a phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab plus S-1 in elderly patients with previously untreated mCRC. Bevacizumab was given intravenously every two weeks, and S-1 was administered orally on days 1-28 of a 42-day cycle. The primary end-point was progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary end-points were time to treatment failure, response rate (RR), overall survival (OS), treatment completion status and safety.RESULTS:  From October 2007 through March 2010, 56 patients were enroled. The median PFS was 9.9months, the median OS was 25.0months, and the RR was 57%. The main adverse events of grade 3 or higher were hypertension (11%), diarrhoea (9%) and neutropenia (7%).: "" Our results suggest that combination chemotherapy with S-1 and bevacizumab can be administered safely and continuously on an outpatient basis and is therapeutically effective in elderly patients with mCRC.'

S' Anti-angiogenic agents combined with histone deacetylase inhibitors act synergistically in vitro and in vivo. We conducted a phase I study of the combination of the anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab and histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid in patients with advanced cancers.METHODS:  Bevacizumab was administered at escalating dosages of 2.5-11 mg/kg on days 1 and 15, and oral valproic acid at dosages of 5.3-10 mg/kg on days 1-28 every 28 days to determine the maximum tolerated dose. Pharmacodynamic parameters were assessed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (histone H3 acetylation) and serum (valproic acid levels).RESULTS:  Fifty-seven patients were enrolled. Dose-limiting toxicities were grade 3 altered mental status (n = 2), related to valproic acid. Bevacizumab 11 mg/kg given on days 1 and 15 and valproic acid 5.3 mg/kg daily were the recommended phase II dosages. Stable disease (SD) \xe2\x89\xa56 months was reported in 4/57 (7 %) of patients, including two patients with colorectal cancer who had progressed previously on bevacizumab. Of the 39 patients evaluated for histone acetylation, 2 of 3 (67 %) patients with SD \xe2\x89\xa56 months showed histone acetylation, while 8 of 36 (22 %) without SD \xe2\x89\xa56 months demonstrated histone acetylation (p = 0.16).

S'Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is involved in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with malignant pleural effusion (MPE), but little is known regarding the efficacy of bevacizumab (Bev) with carboplatin-paclitaxel (CP) for NSCLC with MPE. Chemotherapy-naive non-SQ NSCLC patients with MPE were eligible to participate. Pleurodesis before chemotherapy was not allowed. In the first cycle, the treated patients received only CP to prevent Bev-induced wound healing delayed after chest drainage. Subsequently, they received 2-6 cycles of CP with Bev. Patients who completed more than 4 cycles of CP and Bev without disease progression or severe toxicities continued to receive Bev alone as a maintenance therapy. The primary end point was overall response, although an increase in MPE was allowed in the first cycle. The VEGF levels in plasma and MPE were measured at baseline, and the VEGF levels in plasma were measured after 3 cycles of chemotherapy. Between September 2010 and June 2012, 23 patients were enrolled. The overall response rate was 60.8\xc2\xa0%; the disease control rate was 87.0\xc2\xa0%. Sixteen patients received maintenance therapy, following a median of 3 cycles. Median progression-free and overall survival times were 7.1\xc2\xa0months (95\xc2\xa0% confidence interval [CI], 5.6-9.4\xc2\xa0months) and 11.7\xc2\xa0months (95\xc2\xa0% CI, 7.4-16.8\xc2\xa0months), respectively. Most patients experienced severe hematological toxicities, including \xe2\x89\xa5grade 3 neutropenia; none experienced severe bleeding events. The MPE control rate improved on combining CP with Bev (CP, 78.3\xc2\xa0%; CP with Bev, 91.3\xc2\xa0%; P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.08). The median baseline VEGF level in MPE was 1798.6 (range 223.4-35,633.4) pg/mL.

Primary endpoint was the overall response rate (ORR). Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) were evaluated using the CellSearch system at different time points during therapy.RESULTS:  Eighty-three women were enrolled with median age 62 years, performance status 0-1 in 93%, triple negative disease in 12% and liver metastases in 47%. In an intention to treat analysis, complete response was achieved in 13 (15.7%) and partial response in 42 (50.6%) (overall response rate 66.3%; 95% CI 56.09-76.44%). The median time to progression was 20.1 months and the 1-year overall survival rate 82.3%.

There were two deaths possibly related to study treatment (sigmoid perforation n = 1; sudden death n = 1). Moreover, one patient developed pulmonary embolism and another one myocardial infarction while on treatment. Although DEB administration significantly reduced the proportion of patients presenting CTCs, the detection of \xe2\x89\xa55 or \xe2\x89\xa51 CTCs before treatment initiation was significantly associated with worse progression-free survival (p = 0.001 and p = 0.004) and overall survival (p = 0.001 and p = 0.027), respectively.S:  The DEB regimen is a very active but also potentially toxic combination in MBC.

Patients with unresectable liver metastases were randomised to bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) plus mFOLFOX-6 [oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2), folinic acid 400 mg/m(2), 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m(2) (bolus) then 2400 mg/m(2) (46-h infusion)] or FOLFOXIRI [oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2), irinotecan 165 mg/m(2), folinic acid 200 mg/m(2), 5-fluorouracil 3200 mg/m(2) (46-h infusion)] every 2 weeks. Unresectability was defined as \xe2\x89\xa51 of the following criteria: no possibility of upfront R0/R1 resection of all lesions; <30% residual liver volume after resection; metastases in contact with major vessels of the remnant liver. Resectability was evaluated by multidisciplinary review. The primary end point was overall resection rate (R0/R1/R2). Efficacy end points were analysed by intention-to-treat analysis.RESULTS:  In patients assigned to bevacizumab-FOLFOXIRI (n = 41) or bevacizumab-mFOLFOX-6 (n = 39), the overall resection rate was 61% [95% confidence interval (CI) 45% to 76%] and 49% (95% CI 32% to 65%), respectively (difference 12%; 95% CI -11% to 36%). R0 resection rates were 49% and 23%, respectively. Overall tumour response rates were 81% (95% CI 65% to 91%) with bevacizumab-FOLFOXIRI and 62% (95% CI 45% to 77%) with bevacizumab-mFOLFOX-6. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 18\xc2\xb76 (95% CI 12.9-22.3) months and 11\xc2\xb75 (95% CI 9.6-13.6) months, respectively. The most common grade 3-5 adverse events were neutropenia (bevacizumab-FOLFOXIRI, 50%; bevacizumab-mFOLFOX-6, 35%) and diarrhoea (30% and 14%, respectively).S:  Bevacizumab-FOLFOXIRI was associated with higher response and resection rates and prolonged PFS versus bevacizumab-mFOLFOX-6 in patients with initially unresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer.

Bevacizumab was administered at 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks for 3 cycles during chemoradiation. For OS, failure was defined as death of any cause and was measured from study entry to date of death. LRF was defined as any failure in the pelvis. PAF was defined as any para-aortic nodal failure. DF was analyzed both including and excluding PAF. DFS was measured from study entry to date of first LRF. DF was measured with or without PAF or death. OS and DFS were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and LRF and DF rates were estimated by the cumulative incidence method.RESULTS:  49 eligible patients from 28 institutions were enrolled between 2006 and 2009. The median follow-up time was 3.8 years (range, 0.8-6.0 years). The surviving patients had a median follow-up time of 3.9 years (range, 2.1-6.0 years). Most patients had tumors of International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics Stage IIB (63%), and 80% were squamous. The 3-year OS, DFS, and LRF were 81.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 67.2%-89.8%), 68.7% (95% CI, 53.5%-79.8%), and 23.2% (95% CI, 11%-35.4%), respectively. The PAF, DF without PAF, and DF with PAF at 3 years were 8.4% (95% CI, 0.4%-16.3%), 14.7% (95% CI, 4.5%-24.9%), and 23.1% (95% CI 11.0%-35.2%), respectively.: "" In this study, bevacizumab in combination with standard pelvic chemoradiation therapy for locally advanced cervical cancer showed efficacy results that are promising and may warrant further investigation.'

S' To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravitreal bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) using 2 different treatment regimens in which patients were assessed clinically at up to 12-week intervals.DESIGN: "DESIGN" Randomized, controlled, noninferiority trial.PARTICIPANTS: "PARTICIPANTS" A total of 331 patients with nAMD.METHODS:  Patients were treated with 1.25 mg intravitreal bevacizumab and followed up to 92 weeks. They were randomized into 2 arms. All patients received 3 loading doses 4 weeks apart and thereafter were assessed every 12 weeks until the end of the study. One arm received a routine treatment at each 12-week assessment, and the other arm was treated at these assessments on an as-needed basis. After the loading doses, patients in either arm who showed signs of disease activity had an additional assessment after 6 weeks and at that visit had top-up treatments on an as-needed basis.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES" Mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 92 weeks.RESULTS:  At 92 weeks, patients who had treatments every 12 weeks had superior BCVA to those treated on an as-needed basis every 12 weeks (P = 0.008), with the regular treatment arm gaining a mean BCVA of 5.5 letters and the as-needed treatment arm gaining 0.6 letters. The regular treatment arm of the study showed significantly improved outcomes with respect to 5-, 10-, and 15-letter changes in BCVA from baseline compared with the as-needed treatment arm, as well as superior reading speed. In patients who completed the study, up to but not including week 92, the mean number of treatments was 10.8 for the regular treatment arm and 9.1 for the as-needed treatment arm.S:  A treatment regimen with regular bevacizumab injections every 12 weeks after loading doses supplemented with as-needed top-up treatments produced a stable improvement in BCVA from baseline. The improvement in BCVA was broadly similar to that obtained in other studies using anti-vascular endothelial growth factor drugs with more frequent assessments and treatments.'

S'The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of intravitreal dexamethasone sodium phosphate (DSP) combined with bevacizumab for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In this non comparative case study, 30 eyes of 27 patients with CNV due to AMD received intravitreal DSP (0.2 mg) and bevacizumab (1.25 mg) during a 6-month PRN (pro re nata) dosing regimen. Visual acuity, macular thickness and intraocular pressure (IOP) were monitored and recorded. After 6 months, mean retinal thickness decreased from 423.5 \xc2\xb1 75.3 to 228.2 \xc2\xb1 34.5 and mean visual acuity improved from 0.9 \xc2\xb1 0.39 logMAR to 0.53 \xc2\xb1 0.34 (p = 0.001) logMAR. During the trial period, 81 intravitreal injections were performed in 30 eyes, thus the mean number of injections per eye was 2.7 \xc2\xb1 1.1. 86.7% of the eyes required 3 or less injections while only 13.3% needed 4 or more injections. None of the patients, phakic or pseudophakic, manifested an elevation of IOP during the treatment, ranging between 12 and 22 mmHg. Combined DSP and bevacizumab offers encouraging results in the challenge of AMD treatment, providing immediate response of macular edema, reduced number of intravitreal injections and stabilization or improvement of visual acuity.'

S'"INTRODUCTION" In the phase III AVAPERL trial, patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer receiving bevacizumab-plus-pemetrexed maintenance after first-line induction had a significant progression-free survival benefit relative to those treated with single-agent bevacizumab maintenance but with an increase in grade \xe2\x89\xa53 adverse events. Here, we compare health-related quality of life (HRQOL) between AVAPERL maintenance arms.METHODS:  Patient-reported outcomes were collected at designated intervals from preinduction to final visits. HRQOL was assessed using the self-administered European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 and the Quality of Life Lung Cancer-Specific Module 13. Differences in scores of 10 points or more between arms were above the minimum important difference threshold and considered clinically meaningful.RESULTS:  During induction, patient-reported coughing symptoms improved slightly, whereas fatigue and appetite loss scores worsened relative to preinduction baseline. During maintenance, changes in mean global health status and the majority of Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 and Quality of Life Lung Cancer-Specific Module 13 subscale scores did not differ between trial arms by the minimum important difference defining clinically meaningful (better or worse) patient-reported outcomes. Exceptions were patient-reported role functional status, fatigue symptoms and appetite loss symptoms (favoring bevacizumab), and pain in arm or shoulder symptoms (favoring bevacizumab-plus-pemetrexed maintenance), which differed by clinically meaningful amounts at more than one maintenance assessment.S:  In AVAPERL, HRQOL remained relatively stable throughout maintenance and was generally similar in both arms. Despite an increase in adverse event rates, the addition of pemetrexed to bevacizumab maintenance resulted in similar stabilization of disease symptoms with improved efficacy outcomes.'

S' To evaluate whether the addition of bevacizumab (BVZ) to capecitabine-based chemoradiotherapy in the preoperative treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) improves efficacy measured by the pathological complete response (pCR) rate.METHODS:  A phase II two-step design was performed. Patients received four cycles of therapy consisting of: BVZ 10\xc2\xa0mg/kg in first infusion on day 1 and 5\xc2\xa0mg/kg on days 15, 29, 43, capecitabine 1800\xc2\xa0mg/m(2)/day 5\xc2\xa0days per week during radiotherapy, which consisted of external-beam irradiation (45\xc2\xa0Gy in 1.8\xc2\xa0Gy dose per session over 5 sessions/week for 5\xc2\xa0weeks). Six to eight weeks after completion of all therapies surgery was undergone. To profile the biological behaviour during BVZ treatment we measured molecular biomarkers before treatment, during BVZ monotherapy, and during and after combination therapy. Microvessel density (MVD) was measured after surgery.RESULTS:  Forty-three patients were assessed and 41 were included in the study. Three patients achieved a pathological complete response (3/40: 7.5%) and 27 (67.5%) had a pathological partial response, (overall pathological response rate of 75%). A further 8 patients (20%) had stable disease, giving a disease control rate of 95%. Downstaging occurred in 31 (31/40: 77.5%) of the patients evaluated. This treatment resulted in an actuarial 4-year disease-free and overall survival of 85.4 and 92.7% respectively. BVZ with chemoradiotherapy showed acceptable toxicity. No correlations were observed between biomarker results and efficacy variables.: "" BVZ with capecitabine and radiotherapy seem safe and active and produce promising survival results in LARC.'

S' Perioperatory chemoradiotherapy (CRT) improves local control and survival in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). The objective of the current study was to evaluate the addition of bevacizumab (BEV) to preoperative capecitabine (CAP)-based CRT in LARC, and to explore biomarkers for downstaging.METHODS:  Patients (pts) were randomized to receive 5\xc2\xa0weeks of radiotherapy 45\xc2\xa0Gy/25 fractions with concurrent CAP 825\xc2\xa0mg/m(2) twice daily 5\xc2\xa0days per week and BEV 5\xc2\xa0mg/kg once every 2\xc2\xa0weeks (3 doses) (arm A), or the same schedule without BEV (arm B). The primary end point was pathologic complete response (ypCR: ypT0N0).RESULTS:  Ninety pts were included in arm A (44) or arm B (46). Grade 3-4 treatment-related toxicity rates were 16% and 13%, respectively. All patients but one (arm A) proceeded to surgery. The ypCR rate was 16% in arm A and 11% in arm B (p =0.54). Fifty-nine percent vs 39% of pts achieved T-downstaging (arm A vs arm B; p =0.04). Serial samples for biomarker analyses were obtained for 50 out of 90 randomized pts (arm A/B: 22/28). Plasma angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) levels decreased in arm A and increased in arm B (p <0.05 at all time points). Decrease in Ang-2 levels from baseline to day 57 was significantly associated with tumor downstaging (p =0.02).S:  The addition of BEV to CAP-based preoperative CRT has shown to be feasible in LARC. The association between decreasing Ang-2 levels and tumor downstaging should be further validated in customized studies.'

S' Randomized ovarian cancer trials, including ICON7, have reported improved progression-free survival (PFS) when bevacizumab was added to conventional cytotoxic therapy. The improvement was modest prompting the search for predictive biomarkers for bevacizumab.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN" Pretreatment training (n=91) and validation (n=114) blood samples were provided by ICON7 patients. Plasma concentrations of 15 angio-associated factors were determined using validated multiplex ELISAs. Our statistical approach adopted PFS as the primary outcome measure and involved (i) searching for biomarkers with prognostic relevance or which related to between-individual variation in bevacizumab effect; (ii) unbiased determination of cutoffs for putative biomarker values; (iii) investigation of biologically meaningfully predictive combinations of putative biomarkers; and (iv) replicating the analysis on candidate biomarkers in the validation dataset.RESULTS:  The combined values of circulating Ang1 (angiopoietin 1) and Tie2 (Tunica internal endothelial cell kinase 2) concentrations predicted improved PFS in bevacizumab-treated patients in the training set. Using median concentrations as cutoffs, high Ang1/low Tie2 values were associated with significantly improved PFS for bevacizumab-treated patients in both datasets (median, 23.0 months vs. 16.2; P=0.003) for the interaction of Ang1-Tie2 treatment in Cox regression analysis. The prognostic indices derived from the training set also distinguished high and low probability for progression in the validation set (P=0.008), generating similar values for HR (0.21 vs. 0.27) between treatment and control arms for patients with high Ang1 and low Tie2 values.S:  The combined values of Ang1 and Tie2 are predictive biomarkers for improved PFS in bevacizumab-treated patients with ovarian cancer. These findings need to be validated in larger trials due to the limitation of sample size in this study.'

One-hundred sixty patients with recurrent GBM enrolled as part of a HIPAA-compliant, multicenter clinical trial (AVF3708 g, BRAIN trial). Contrast-enhancing tumor volumes and change in volumes as a response to therapy were quantified by using either conventional segmentation or CE T1-weighted subtraction maps created by voxel-by-voxel subtraction of intensity-normalized nonenhanced T1-weighted images from CE T1-weighted images. These volumes were then tested as predictors of PFS and OS by using log-rank univariate analysis, the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model, and receiver operating characteristic analysis.RESULTS:  Use of CE T1-weighted subtraction maps qualitatively improved visualization and improved quantification of tumor volume after bevacizumab treatment. Significant trends between the volume of tumor and change in tumor volume after therapy on CE T1-weighted subtraction maps were found for both PFS and OS (pretreatment volume < 15 cm(3), P < .003; posttreatment volume < 7.5 cm(3), P < .05; percentage change in volume > 25%, P = .004 for PFS and P = .053 for OS). CE T1-weighted subtraction maps were significantly better at aiding prediction of 6-month PFS and 12-month OS compared with conventional segmentation by using receiver operating characteristic analysis (P < .05).'

S'Ipilimumab improves survival in advanced melanoma and can induce immune-mediated tumor vasculopathy. Besides promoting angiogenesis, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) suppresses dendritic cell maturation and modulates lymphocyte endothelial trafficking. This study investigated the combination of CTLA4 blockade with ipilimumab and VEGF inhibition with bevacizumab. Patients with metastatic melanoma were treated in four dosing cohorts of ipilimumab (3 or 10 mg/kg) with four doses at 3-week intervals and then every 12 weeks, and bevacizumab (7.5 or 15 mg/kg) every 3 weeks. Forty-six patients were treated. Inflammatory events included giant cell arteritis (n = 1), hepatitis (n = 2), and uveitis (n = 2). On-treatment tumor biopsies revealed activated vessel endothelium with extensive CD8(+) and macrophage cell infiltration. Peripheral blood analyses demonstrated increases in CCR7(+/-)/CD45RO(+) cells and anti-galectin antibodies. Best overall response included 8 partial responses, 22 instances of stable disease, and a disease-control rate of 67.4%. Median survival was 25.1 months. Bevacizumab influences changes in tumor vasculature and immune responses with ipilimumab administration. The combination of bevacizumab and ipilimumab can be safely administered and reveals VEGF-A blockade influences on inflammation, lymphocyte trafficking, and immune regulation. These findings provide a basis for further investigating the dual roles of angiogenic factors in blood vessel formation and immune regulation, as well as future combinations of antiangiogenesis agents and immune checkpoint blockade.'

S' Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody with high antitumor activity against malignant diseases. Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of first-line bevacizumab combination therapy in advanced, non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NS-NSCLC). SAiL (MO19390), an open-label, multicenter, single-arm study, evaluated the safety and efficacy of first-line bevacizumab-based treatment in clinical practice. This report presents the results of a subgroup analysis of Chinese patients enrolled in SAiL.METHODS:  Chemo-naive Chinese patients with locally advanced, metastatic or recurrent NSCLC were randomized to receive Bev 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks plus carboplatin + paclitaxel for maximum of six cycles, followed by single-agent bevacizumab until disease progression. The primary endpoint was safety. Secondary endpoints included time to progression and overall survival.RESULTS:  The Chinese intent-to-treat (ITT) population consists of 198 Chinese patients, among whom 107 (54 %) were non-smokers and 90 (45.5 %) were female. The median cycle of bevacizumab administration was 10 and median duration of bevacizumab treatment was 29.5 weeks. Only eight cases of severe adverse events were observed in the study, which were deemed to be related to bevacizumab. The incidence of AEs over grade 3 in Chinese ITT patients was generally low (<9 %). No new safety signals were reported. Objective response rate in 195 evaluable Chinese patients was 68.8 %, including four complete responses (2.1 %). Time to disease progression (TTP) and overall survival were 8.8 and 18.5 months, respectively.S:  The safety and efficacy of first-line bevacizumab-based treatment in Chinese population with advanced NS-NSCLC are consistent with those in previous studies as well as in Asian subgroup population from SAiL study.

Prespecified biomarkers were prospectively evaluated.METHODS:  Tumor samples were analyzed for: epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression (immunohistochemistry [IHC]); EGFR gene copy number (fluorescence in-situ hybridization [FISH]); EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletions/L858R mutations); and KRAS mutations (exons 2/3). Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated.RESULTS:  Of 743 patients randomized to receive maintenance treatment (after four cycles of B+C without progression), 190 (B+E) and 177 (B+P) were evaluable for biomarker status. Median PFS (from randomization) was 4.4 months (B+E) versus 3.7 months (B+P; hazard ratio [HR], 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-0.99), which was numerically similar to the intent-to-treat PFS. PFS benefit of B+E was observed across most biomarker subgroups. EGFR IHC, EGFR FISH, and EGFR/KRAS mutation status were not predictive of outcome. B+E-treated patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC had longer PFS compared with B+P-treated patients (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.22-0.86; p = 0.0139). Patients with KRAS wild-type disease had significant PFS improvements with B+E, compared with B+P (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.485-0.914; p = 0.0105). No OS benefit of B+E was observed.S:  Patients with KRAS wild-type or EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC derived PFS benefits from B+E. However, EGFR IHC, EGFR FISH, and EGFR or KRAS mutation status were not strongly predictive of survival. A larger sample size would be needed to confirm the initial trends observed in this study.'

S'"INTRODUCTION" This phase 2 randomized study evaluated trebananib (AMG 386), a peptide-Fc fusion protein that inhibits angiogenesis by neutralizing the interaction of angiopoietin-1 and -2 with Tie2, in combination with paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab in previously untreated patients with HER2-negative locally recurrent/metastatic breast cancer.METHODS:  Patients received paclitaxel 90\xc2\xa0mg/m(2) once weekly (3-weeks-on/1-week-off) and were randomly assigned 1:1:1:1 to also receive blinded bevacizumab 10\xc2\xa0mg/kg once every 2 weeks plus either trebananib 10\xc2\xa0mg/kg once weekly (Arm A) or 3\xc2\xa0mg/kg once weekly (Arm B), or placebo (Arm C); or open-label trebananib 10\xc2\xa0mg/kg once a week (Arm D). Progression-free survival was the primary endpoint.RESULTS:  In total, 228 patients were randomized. Median estimated progression-free survival for Arms A, B, C, and D was 11.3, 9.2, 12.2, and 10 months, respectively. Hazard ratios (95% CI) for Arms A, B, and D versus Arm C were 0.98 (0.61-1.59), 1.12 (0.70-1.80), and 1.28 (0.79-2.09), respectively. The objective response rate was 71% in Arm A, 51% in Arm B, 60% in Arm C, and 46% in Arm D. The incidence of grade 3/4/5 adverse events was 71/9/4%, 61/14/5%, 62/16/3%, and 52/4/7% in Arms A/B/C/D. In Arm D, median progression-free survival was 12.8 and 7.4 months for those with high and low trebananib exposure (AUCss\xc2\xa0\xe2\x89\xa5\xc2\xa08.4 versus\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa08.4\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xb7h/mL), respectively.S:  There was no apparent prolongation of estimated progression-free survival with the addition of trebananib to paclitaxel and bevacizumab at the doses tested. Toxicity was manageable. Exposure-response analyses support evaluation of combinations incorporating trebananib at doses\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa010\xc2\xa0mg/kg in this setting.'

S' Increased tumor hypoxia and hence elevated hypoxia-inducible factor-1\xce\xb1 (HIF1\xce\xb1) is thought to limit the efficacy of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway-targeting drugs by upregulating adaptive resistance genes. One strategy to counteract this is to combine antiangiogenic drugs with agents able to suppress HIF1\xce\xb1. One such possibility is the investigational drug CRLX101, a nanoparticle-drug conjugate (NDC) containing the payload camptothecin, a known topoisomerase-I poison.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN" CRLX101 was evaluated both as a monotherapy and combination with bevacizumab in a preclinical mouse model of advanced metastatic ovarian cancer. These preclinical studies contributed to the rationale for undertaking a phase II clinical study to evaluate CRLX101 monotherapy in patients with advanced platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.RESULTS:  Preclinically, CRLX101 is highly efficacious as a monotherapy when administered at maximum-tolerated doses. Furthermore, chronic low-dose CRLX101 with bevacizumab reduced bevacizumab-induced HIF1\xce\xb1 upregulation and resulted in synergistic efficacy, with minimal toxicity in mice. In parallel, initial data reported here from an ongoing phase II clinical study of CRLX101 monotherapy shows measurable tumor reductions in 74% of patients and a 16% RECIST response rate to date.S:  Given these preclinical and initial clinical results, further clinical studies are currently evaluating CRLX101 in combination with bevacizumab in ovarian cancer and warrant the evaluation of this therapy combination in other cancer types where HIF1\xce\xb1 is implicated in pathogenesis, as it may potentially be able to improve the efficacy of antiangiogenic drugs.'

S'"" To explore the clinical efficacies of bevacizumab (BEV) for high-grade glioma (HGG) in Chinese patients and evaluate its profiles of adverse events and usage safety.METHODS:  A total of 15 HGG cases, including glioblastoma multiform (GBM) (n = 12) and anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) (n = 3), were selected to receive the treatments of BEV (10 mg/kg, q2w) and temozolomide (TMZ, 150 mg/m(2), 5 d/28 d). Their radiological responses, clinical status, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. Also their adverse events and severity were recorded and analyzed.RESULTS:  According to the RANO criteria, during the short period (<3 months), 11 cases had significant radiological and clinical responses. However, only 4 cases responded during a follow-up period of beyond 3 months. Three cases had retrogression after BEV chemotherapy. At 6 months post-treatment, 8 cases (53.3%) survived without lesion progression and the median PFS was 8 \xc2\xb1 5 months. During a longer follow-up (>6 months), 8 patients had tumor retrogression, including 5 deaths. The median overall survival period was 24 \xc2\xb1 10 months. The adverse events included hypertension (n = 2), wound-healing complication (n = 1), vomiting (n = 2) and cerebro-spinal fluid leakage (n = 1). All complications were cured by activate supportive measures.: "" After BEV treatment, most patients obtain more significant short-term responses with good toleration. For re-operative cases, the usage of BEV should be deferred to one month post-operation so as to avoid the occurrence of wound-healing complications.'

S' To evaluate the effectiveness of low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT) and FOLFIRI-bevacizumab (FOLFIRI-B) combination in metastatic colorectal cancer.METHODS:  The primary objective of the study is to raise the clinical complete response (CR) rate from 5% to 25%. Secondary objectives include toxicity and progression-free survival. Patients underwent 12 FOLFIRI-B cycles plus two daily LDRT (20 cGy/6-hour interval) on the first and second days of each cycle.RESULTS:  CR and toxicity of 10 patients are reported. Considering irradiated sites, 10/10 patients had clinical partial response (PR) (7/10) or CR (3/10). Three clinical PR patients subsequently underwent surgery and reported a pathological CR in the irradiated sites. Grade 3-4 toxicities rate was 30%. With a median follow-up of 29 months (range: 12-49 months), 2/10 progression of disease in irradiated sites and 3/5 in non-irradiated sites were observed.S:  The very high response rate requires urgent verification in a larger patient series.'

S' Bevacizumab prolongs progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. We analysed the protein expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) ligands and receptors to determine their prognostic and predictive effects.METHODS:  We graded expression of VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, VEGF-R1, and VEGF-R2 to assess whether overexpression predicted bevacizumab resistance in samples from 268 of 471 patients randomised to capecitabine (C), capecitabine and bevacizumab (CB), or CB and mitomycin (CBM) in the MAX trial and extended the analysis to the CAIRO-2 population.RESULTS:  Patients with low expression of VEGF-D (0, 1\xc3\xbe) benefited from bevacizumab treatment (PFS hazard ratio (HR) (C vs CB\xc3\xbeCBM), 0.21; 95% CI, 0.08\xe2\x80\x930.55; overall survival (OS) HR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.13\xe2\x80\x930.90). Patients with higher VEGF-D expression received less benefit (VEGF-D 2\xc3\xbe PFS HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.45\xe2\x80\x931.00; OS HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.52\xe2\x80\x931.30; VEGF-D 3\xc3\xbe PFS HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.50\xe2\x80\x931.17; OS HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.79\xe2\x80\x932.09) (P interaction o0.05). In CAIRO-2, there was no difference in PFS or OS according to VEGF-D expression.S:  The predictive value of VEGF-D expression for bevacizumab may depend on the chemotherapy backbone used.

S'"AIM OF THE STUDY" Gastro-intestinal neuroendocrine tumours (GI-NETs) are chemotherapy-resistant tumours. Bevacizumab, an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has shown promising results in several phase II trials of gastro-entero-pancreatic-NETs. We assessed bevacizumab combined with capecitabine, specifically in GI-NET patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  BEvacizumab in The Treament of neuroEndocrine tumoRs (BETTER) was a multicentre, open-label, non-randomised, two-group phase II trial. Here we present the group of patients with progressive, metastatic, well-differentiated GI-NETs.

S' Several phase-III studies have shown improvements in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) with bevacizumab when added to chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer. However, the extent of improvement varied and none of the trials showed benefit in terms of overall survival (OS).PATIENTS AND METHODS:  All patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with bevacizumab at our Institution between 2005 and 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. A control group was matched according to the following variables: receptor status, treatment line, type of chemotherapy, presence of visceral disease and age.RESULTS:  All 212 patients were evaluable for toxicity, and 198 for response; 430 controls allowed a complete matching for 85 bevacizumab-treated patients. The addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy significantly prolonged PFS (9.3 vs. 7.6 months, hazard ratio [HR]=0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.51-0.97, p=0.031) and OS (28.9 vs. 22.6 months, HR=0.67, 95% CI=0.45-0.99, p=0.043). Clinical benefit rate (overall response rate + stable disease for at least six months) was significantly better in the bevacizumab group (75% vs. 59%, p=0.002), while ORR did not differ significantly (48% vs. 35%, p=0.21). Patients developing hypertension during treatment had a more favourable outcome (PFS 13.7 vs. 6.6 months, HR=0.34, 95% CI=0.23-0.49 p<0.001; 2-year OS 78% vs. 30%, HR=0.20, 95% CI=0.12-0.35, p<0.001).: "" Bevacizumab in addition to chemotherapy prolonged PFS and OS in a non-selected, partly intensively pre-treated breast cancer population.

S' We performed a retrospective study to assess whether the initial molecular characteristics of glioblastomas (GBMs) were associated with the response to the bevacizumab/irinotecan chemotherapy regimen given at recurrence.RESULTS:  Comparison of the genomic and gene expression profiles of the responders (n = 12) and nonresponders (n = 13) demonstrated only slight differences and could not identify any robust biomarkers associated with the response. In contrast, a significant association was observed between GBMs molecular subtypes and response rates. GBMs assigned to molecular subtype IGS-18 and to classical subtype had a lower response rate than those assigned to other subtypes. In an independent series of 33 patients, neither EGFR amplification nor CDKN2A deletion (which are frequent in IGS-18 and classical GBMs) was significantly associated with the response rate, suggesting that these two alterations are unlikely to explain the lower response rate of these GBMs molecular subtypes.: "" Despite its limited sample size, the present study suggests that comparing the initial molecular profiles of responders and nonresponders might not be an effective strategy to identify biomarkers of the response to bevacizumab given at recurrence.

S'Docetaxel-containing chemotherapy improves disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival in patients with early stage breast cancer. Bevacizumab improves response rate and DFS in metastatic breast cancer. However, adding antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy to anthracycline-containing chemotherapy may increase cardiotoxicity. This trial evaluates the feasibility of adding bevacizumab to three standard adjuvant docetaxel regimens with a primary endpoint of grade \xe2\x89\xa53 congestive heart failure (CHF). Phase IIb, randomized, non-comparative study of women with previously untreated node-positive or high-risk node-negative breast cancer. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative patients were randomized to: (arm A) doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel or (arm B) docetaxel + doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide. HER2-positive patients (arm C) received docetaxel + carboplatin + trastuzumab for 52 weeks. All patients received bevacizumab beginning on day 1 for 52 weeks. Safety data in 212 women (mean age = 53.1 years) show that 1 patient each in arm A (1.3 %) and arm C (1.7 %), and 3 patients in arm B (4.0 %) experienced clinical CHF grade \xe2\x89\xa53. A decreased ejection fraction was observed in 1 patient each in arms A and C, and cardiac disorder was observed in 12.8, 22.7, and 8.5 % in arms A, B, and C, respectively. A grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse event was reported in 82.1, 84.0, and 52.5 % of participants in arms A, B, and C, respectively. Kaplan-Meier estimates of DFS show rates at 24 months of 85.5, 90.4, and 90.4 % in arms A, B, and C, respectively. Adding bevacizumab to three standard docetaxel-based chemotherapy regimens as adjuvant treatment in patients with node-positive and high-risk node-negative breast cancer resulted in a low rate of clinical CHF grade \xe2\x89\xa53. Maintenance bevacizumab monotherapy did not identify any new safety signals.

Patients could receive treatment until PD or unacceptable toxicity.RESULTS:  Thirty-six patients were enrolled; 35 received at least one treatment dose. Two dose-limiting toxicities were observed across the dose range (Grade 3 dehydration and fatigue) with neither suggestive of a consistent toxicity pattern. IMO-2055 0.32 mg/kg was adopted as RP2D based on clinical and pharmacodynamic data. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were diarrhea (74 %), nausea (51 %), fatigue (51 %), rash (51 %), and injection-site reactions (49 %). Four patients experienced serious TEAEs considered to be study drug related. Five patients died, all due to PD.

S' The combination of an anti-VEGF or an anti-EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibody with chemotherapy has shown clinical activity in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. However, combining both anti-VEGF and anti-EGFR antibodies with chemotherapy in first-line treatment resulted in adverse outcomes. We assessed whether the combination of erlotinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, with bevacizumab could increase the efficacy of maintenance therapy in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer.METHODS: This randomised, open-label, phase 3 study was undertaken in 49 centres in France, Austria, and Canada. Eligible patients were aged 18-80 years with histologically confirmed, unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer, WHO performance status 0-2, had received no previous therapy for metastatic disease, and had adequate organ function.

At 9 months of age, all eyes treated with a bevacizumab injection were noted to have abnormalities at the periphery (large avascular area, abnormal branching, shunt) or the posterior pole (hyperfluorescent lesion, absence of foveal avascular zone). These posterior and peripheral lesions were not observed in the majority of the lasered eyes.S:  This study documents significant vascular and macular abnormalities of eyes in the bevacizumab group. Long-lasting implications of these abnormalities for visual function of the child need to be studied.'

S' We hypothesized that a window period between bevacizumab and cytotoxic agents may enhance drug delivery into tumor tissue through bevacizumab-induced vascular normalization in patients with brain metastases of breast cancer (BMBC).EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN" A single-arm phase II study was conducted in which BMBC patients refractory to whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) were enrolled. In a 21-day cycle, patients received bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) on day 1, which, with a 1-day window period, was followed by etoposide (70 mg/m(2)/day; days 2-4) and cisplatin (70 mg/m(2); day 2; BEEP regimen). The BEEP regimen was administered for a maximum of 6 cycles. The primary endpoint was the central nervous system (CNS)-objective response rate according to volumetric response criteria.RESULTS:  A total of 35 patients were enrolled between January 2011 and January 2013. The median age was 54.3 years (range, 33-75); 19 patients (54.3%) had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or 3. Twenty-seven patients [77.1%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 59.9-89.6] achieved a CNS-objective response, including 13 patients (37.1%) with a \xe2\x89\xa580% volumetric reduction of CNS lesions. With a median follow-up of 16.1 months, the median CNS progression-free survival and overall survival times were 7.3 months (95% CI, 6.5-8.1) and 10.5 months (95% CI, 7.8-13.2), respectively. Common grade 3 or 4 toxicities included neutropenia (30.8%) and infection (21.3%).S:  By administering bevacizumab 1 day before etoposide and cisplatin, the BEEP regimen appeared highly effective in BMBC refractory to WBRT. Further study of vascular normalization window concept is warranted.'

S' An effective and well tolerated treatment is needed for patients with early HER2-positive breast cancer who do not achieve a pathological complete response after neoadjuvant therapy. The AVATAXHER trial aimed to predict pathological complete response early with the use of PET and to investigate whether the addition of bevacizumab could improve the proportion of patients achieving a pathological complete response in patients unlikely to respond to treatment.METHODS: AVATAXHER was a randomised, open-label, non-comparative, multicentre phase 2 study that enrolled women (\xe2\x89\xa518 years of age) with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer from 26 oncology centres in France. Patients initially received two cycles of neoadjuvant docetaxel (100 mg/m(2) intravenously every 3 weeks) plus trastuzumab (8 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks then 6 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for the second course). Before the first and second cycles, [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET was done and the change in standardised uptake value was used to predict pathological complete response in each patient. Patients who were predicted to be responders on PET continued to receive standard therapy. Predicted non-responders were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive four cycles of docetaxel (100 mg/m(2) intravenously every 3 weeks) and trastuzumab (6 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks) plus bevacizumab (15 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks; group A) or continue on docetaxel plus trastuzumab alone (group B). Randomisation was open label and was done by an adaptive minimisation method. Although investigators and patients were aware of group assignment, the anatomo-pathologist in charge of centralised review of surgical samples and lymph nodes was masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was centrally assessed pathological complete response according to the Chevallier classification. Efficacy analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. Safety analyses in this Article were done on all patients who received at least one dose of treatment starting from cycle 3. Survival outcomes are not yet mature. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (<a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01142778" title="See in ClincalTrials.gov"NCT01142778</a) and EUDRACT (2009-013410-26).FINDINGS: "FINDINGS" Between May 19, 2010, and Oct 1, 2012, 152 patients were recruited for the study. Ten patients were subsequently excluded, leaving 142 patients in the intention-to-treat population. Of these 142 patients, 69 were predicted by [(18)F]-FDG PET to be treatment responders after two cycles of treatment. The 73 predicted non-responders were randomly assigned to group A (n=48) and group B (n=25). Pathological complete responses were noted in 37 (53\xc2\xb76%, 95% CI 41\xc2\xb72-65\xc2\xb77) of the PET responders, 21 (43\xc2\xb78%, 29\xc2\xb75-58\xc2\xb78) of those in group A, and six (24\xc2\xb70%, 9\xc2\xb74-45\xc2\xb71) of those in group B. Incidences of grade 3-4 adverse events were similar in all three groups. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (four in PET responders, five in group A, and three in group B), febrile neutropenia (one, three, and one, respectively), and myalgia (four, none, and one, respectively). Overall, 24 serious adverse events were reported in 15 patients (PET responders: nine events in four [6%] of 67 patients; group A: 14 events in ten [21%] of 47 patients; group B: one event in one [4%] of 25 patients). No deaths occurred during the study.INTERPRETATION: "INTERPRETATION" In patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, early PET assessment can help to identify non-responders to neoadjuvant docetaxel plus trastuzumab therapy. In these patients, the addition of bevacizumab can increase the proportion of patients achieving a pathological complete response. This potential new role for PET and the activity of bevacizumab in this setting need to be confirmed in larger phase 3 trials.FUNDING: "FUNDING" Roche France.'

S'The aim of this Phase I clinical trial was to assess the feasibility and safety of capecitabine-based preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) combined with bevacizumab and to determine the optimal capecitabine dose for Japanese patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Patients with cT3/T4 rectal cancer were eligible. Bevacizumab was administered at 5 mg/kg intravenously on Days 1, 15 and 29. Capecitabine was administered on weekdays concurrently with pelvic radiotherapy at a daily dose of 1.8 Gy, totally to 50.4 Gy. Capecitabine was initiated at 825 mg/m(2) twice daily at Dose Level 1, with a planned escalation to 900 mg/m(2) twice daily at Dose Level 2. Within 6.1-10.3 (median, 9.4) weeks after the completion of the CRT, surgery was performed. Three patients were enrolled at each dose level. Regarding the CRT-related acute toxicities, all of the adverse events were limited to Grade 1. There was no Grade 2 or greater toxicity. No patient needed attenuation or interruption of bevacizumab, capecitabine or radiation. All of the patients received the scheduled dose of CRT. All of the patients underwent R0 resection. Two (33.3%) of the six patients had a pathological complete response, and five (83.3%) patients experienced downstaging. In total, three patients (50%) developed postoperative complications. One patient developed an intrapelvic abscess and healed with incisional drainage. The other two patients healed following conservative treatment. This regimen was safely performed as preoperative CRT for Japanese patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. The recommended capecitabine dose is 900 mg/m(2) twice daily.'

S'"AIM" This phase II study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of docetaxel and bevacizumab combination therapy in patients with previously-treated non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (Nsq NSCLC).PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Patients with histologically- or cytologically-confirmed Nsq NSCLC, 20-74 years of age, who had performance status 0-2, and had undergone at least one prior chemotherapy course were eligible for the study. Patients were treated with docetaxel (60 mg/m(2)) and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) on day 1, which was repeated every three weeks until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity occurred. The primary end-point was the response rate (RR) and the planned sample size was 28 patients.RESULTS:  Between May 2010 and July 2011, 28 patients were enrolled (16 males, 12 females; median age=65 years; performance status 0/1: 19/9; adenocarcinoma/other: 22/6; number of prior chemotherapy courses 1/2/3 or more: 16/5/7). Twenty-eight patients were included in the toxicity analysis, out of whom 27 were evaluable for response. Objective response was observed in 18 patients (partial response in 18, stable disease in 8, progressive disease in 1); the RR and disease control rates were 66.7% and 96.0%, respectively. The median follow-up was 23.9 months, median progression-free survival was 7.2 months, and median overall survival was 21.6 months. The main toxicity associated with this regimen was myelosuppression (grade 3/4 neutropenia: 82.1%; febrile neutropenia: 21%). Mild non-hematological toxicity was observed but there was no severe bleeding.: "" The combination regimen of docetaxel-plus-bevacizumab is very active in patients with previously-treated Nsq NSCLC and warrants further research.'

S'Preoperative bevacizumab and chemotherapy may benefit a subset of breast cancer (BC) patients. To explore potential mechanisms of this benefit, we conducted a phase II study of neoadjuvant bevacizumab (single dose) followed by combined bevacizumab and adriamycin/cyclophosphamide/paclitaxel chemotherapy in HER2-negative BC. The regimen was well-tolerated and showed a higher rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) in triple-negative (TN)BC (11/21 patients or 52%, [95% confidence interval (CI): 30,74]) than in hormone receptor-positive (HR)BC [5/78 patients or 6% (95%CI: 2,14)]. Within the HRBCs, basal-like subtype was significantly associated with pCR (P = 0.007; Fisher exact test). We assessed interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) and tissue biopsies before and after bevacizumab monotherapy and circulating plasma biomarkers at baseline and before and after combination therapy. Bevacizumab alone lowered IFP, but to a smaller extent than previously observed in other tumor types. Pathologic response to therapy correlated with sVEGFR1 postbevacizumab alone in TNBC (Spearman correlation 0.610, P = 0.0033) and pretreatment microvascular density (MVD) in all patients (Spearman correlation 0.465, P = 0.0005). Moreover, increased pericyte-covered MVD, a marker of extent of vascular normalization, after bevacizumab monotherapy was associated with improved pathologic response to treatment, especially in patients with a high pretreatment MVD. These data suggest that bevacizumab prunes vessels while normalizing those remaining, and thus is beneficial only when sufficient numbers of vessels are initially present. This study implicates pretreatment MVD as a potential predictive biomarker of response to bevacizumab in BC and suggests that new therapies are needed to normalize vessels without pruning. '

S'"" OCEANS, a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III trial, found that adding bevacizumab to gemcitabine-carboplatin (GC) significantly improved investigator-determined progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) in platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer. To evaluate the reliability of assessment of progression and objective response per RECIST, radiologic and clinical data were assessed by an independent review committee (IRC).METHODS:  Radiologic images and clinical data were provided prospectively to the IRC for all randomized patients (N=484). Data were reviewed in a blinded fashion per RECIST (modified v1.0). PFS and ORR were analyzed based on the IRC assessment. Concordance between investigator- and IRC-assessed progression and objective response was assessed.RESULTS:  The IRC analysis demonstrated a statistically significant increase in PFS (hazard ratio [HR]=0.451; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.351 to 0.580, p<0.0001) consistent with the benefit reported by investigators (HR=0.484; 95% CI=0.388 to 0.605, p<0.0001). The concordance rate, defined by agreement on progression status, was 74.2% overall, and comparable between treatment arms (bevacizumab, 75.2% vs. placebo, 73.1%). IRC-assessed ORR was significantly improved with bevacizumab (bevacizumab, 74.8% vs. placebo, 53.7%; p<0.0001), consistent with the investigator-assessed results. The concordance rate for objective response was 79.8% overall, and comparable between treatment arms (bevacizumab, 78.9% vs. placebo, 80.6%).S:  IRC-determined results were highly consistent with those determined by investigators, demonstrating that bevacizumab plus GC provides a significant improvement in PFS and ORR. These results suggest that investigators can reliably assess disease progression and objective response in recurrent ovarian cancer using RECIST, without the necessity of a full IRC review.'

S'"S" To assess efficacy of bevacizumab in combination with oral chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer with lymphangitic spread to the chest wall (LBC). To identify surrogate biomarkers of response to bevacizumab.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  We randomly assigned patients to receive bevacizumab plus either sequential or concurrent oral vinorelbine and capecitabine every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was time to ultimate progression (TTP); the response rate and overall survival (OS) were secondary endpoints. We performed gene expression profiling on baseline tissue samples collected from triple negative LBC. We assessed circulating endothelial cells (CEC), circulating endothelial progenitors (CEP) and circulating pericyte progenitors (CPP).RESULTS:  A total of 66 patients were enrolled. There was no difference in TTP (median TTP 5.3 vs. 4.8 months, p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.21) and in OS (median OS 15.8 vs 11.9 months; p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.25) when comparing concurrent vs sequential treatment, respectively. Response rate was 25% vs 28% in the concurrent vs sequential arm (p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa01.00), respectively. A set of 16 genes predictive of response to bevacizumab was identified. The counts of CEPs and viable CECs below the median value were associated with an improved overall survival: 26.6 vs 9.5 months for CEPs and 22.6 vs 11.0 months for viable CECs, respectively (p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.02).S:  Oral chemotherapy and bevacizumab (BEVIX) is an active regimen in patients with LBC. We support the importance of using LBC as a biological model for investigating angiogenesis inhibitors.

S' To measure serum levels of bevacizumab and to compare serum levels of free vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in infants who were treated with either intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (IVB) or laser for type 1 retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).METHODS:  Twenty-four infants with type 1 ROP were randomized into three treatment groups: IVB at 0.625 mg per eye per dose, IVB at 0.25 mg per eye per dose, and laser. Blood samples were collected prior to treatment and on posttreatment days 2, 14, 42, and 60. Weekly body weights were documented from birth until 60 days post treatment. Serum levels of bevacizumab, free VEGF, and IGF-1 were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).RESULTS:  Serum bevacizumab was detected 2 days after the injection, peaked at 14 days, and persisted for up to 60 days with half-life of 21 days. Area under the curve (AUC) analysis showed that systemic exposure to bevacizumab was variable among the subjects and was dose dependent. Serum free VEGF levels decreased in all three subgroups 2 days post treatment, with more significant reductions found in both IVB-treated groups, P = 0.0001. Serum IGF-1 levels were lower in both IVB-treated groups.S:  Clearance of bevacizumab from the bloodstream in premature infants takes at least 2 months. Although serum free VEGF levels decreased following either laser or bevacizumab treatment, the reductions were more significant in the IVB-treated groups. Potential long-term effects of systemic exposure to bevacizumab in infants need to be studied further.'

The primary endpoint was a 6-month progression-fee survival (PFS6) rate for participants with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). Patients with recurrent anaplastic glioma (AG) were evaluated as an exploratory arm of the study.RESULTS:  At interim analysis, the GBM arm did not meet criteria for continued accrual, and the GBM arm was closed. A total of 24 patients with GBM were accrued prior to closure. The PFS6 rate was 30.4% (95%, CI 12.4%-50.7%), median PFS was 5 months (range, 3-9 months), and median overall survival (OS) was 9 months (range, 6-19 months).

S'"INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND" Inhibition of tumor angiogenesis by the interruption of VEGF pathway signaling is of therapeutic value in several solid tumors. Preclinical evidence supports similar importance of the pathway in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In this randomized phase II trial, we compared the efficacy and toxicity of rituximab with bevacizumab versus single-agent rituximab, in patients with previously-treated follicular lymphoma.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Patients (n = 60) were randomized (1:1) to receive rituximab (375 mg/m(2) intravenously [I.V.] weekly for 4 weeks) either as a single agent or with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg I.V. on days 3 and 15). Patients with an objective response or stable disease at week 12 received 4 additional doses of rituximab (at months 3, 5, 7, and 9); patients who received rituximab/bevacizumab also received bevacizumab 10 mg/kg I.V. every 2 weeks for 16 doses.RESULTS:  After a median follow-up of 34 months, PFS was improved in patients who received rituximab/bevacizumab compared with patients who received rituximab alone (median 20.7 vs. 10.4 months respectively; HR, 0.40 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20-0.80); P = .007). Overall survival was also improved numerically (73% vs. 53% at 4 years), but did not reach statistical significance (HR, 0.40 (95% CI, 0.15-1.05); P = .055).

We performed a phase 2 trial of combined bevacizumab and fotemustine for patients with glioblastoma at first relapse after radiotherapy and temozolomide. The primary endpoint was 6-month progression-free survival (PFS), while secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), response rate based on RANO criteria and toxicity. Fifty-four patients with recurrent GBM were enrolled. The authors observed a 6-month PFS rate of 42.6% (95% CI 29.3-55.2) and a median PFS of 5.2 months (95% CI 3.8-6.6). The median OS was 9.1 months (95% CI 7.3-10.3). Twenty-eight patients (52%) had a radiographic response, and a significant neurological improvement with steroid reduction was observed in 25/42 symptomatic patients (60%). MGMT promoter methylation was significantly associated with improved PFS in univariate analysis. Most unifocal tumors at baseline had a focal enhancing progression (76%), while the diffuse non-enhancing progression accounted for 9.5%. Response or survival were not associated with any pattern of progression. Survival after failure of treatment was short. Twelve out of 54 patients (22%) discontinued fotemustine for grade 3/4 myelotoxicity, while 4/54 (7.4%) discontinued bevacizumab. This study failed to demonstrate a superiority of the combination of bevacizumab and fotemustine over either bevacizumab or fotemustine alone as historical controls.

Univariate and multivariable analyses of prognostic factors were performed.RESULTS:  A total of 264 patients were included. The median age was 59 years (range, 31 years-85 years) and all patients had stage IV disease per TNM staging. Normal b-alb was associated with significantly improved median OS (10.2 months vs 4.1 months; P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89.0001), median TTP (6.2 months vs 3.7 months; P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.0488), and disease control rate (71% vs 46%; P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89.007) for patients receiving bevacizumab, but not for those treated without bevacizumab. Multivariable analysis revealed a significant influence of normal b-alb on OS (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89.0008) and TTP (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89.033).S:  Patients with APCA with normal b-alb derive benefit from treatment with bevacizumab. Future prospective investigations of bevacizumab in patients with APCA should consider selecting patients with normal b-alb to maximize potential benefit."

S' Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor, has shown increased pathological complete response rates when added to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In various cancer types, bevacizumab treatment was accompanied by an increased risk of bleedings and other surgical complications. We assessed associated surgical complications.METHODS:  In the GeparQuinto trial, 1,948 patients were randomized to receive four cycles epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (EC, 90/600\xc2\xa0mg/m(2) q3w) followed by four cycles docetaxel (D, 100\xc2\xa0mg/m(2) q3w) each with (ECB-DB) or without (EC-D) bevacizumab (B, 15\xc2\xa0mg/kg q3w) concurrent with chemotherapy. Surgery had to be performed not earlier than 28\xc2\xa0days after the last bevacizumab infusion, but within days 21 and 35 after the last chemotherapy.RESULTS:  In 743 (38.1\xc2\xa0%) patients, a surgical complication (bleedings, hematomas, necrosis, wound infections, abscess) was documented prospectively. Baseline characteristics of the patients were well balanced between both arms. The breast-conserving surgery (BCS) rate (N\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0502) was 69.1\xc2\xa0% (EC-D) and 71.9\xc2\xa0% (ECB-DB; p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.464). The first surgical procedure was performed at a median of 29 (EC-D) and 34\xc2\xa0days (ECB-DB) after last chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab infusion (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001). Surgical complications were documented in 38 (10.9\xc2\xa0%; EC-D) and 59 (15.0\xc2\xa0%; ECB-DB) patients (p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.103). Surgical complications were significantly higher after ECD-DB only in patients treated with BCS (N\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa053; p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.029) or in those requiring repeat surgery in order achieve clear margins (N\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa023; p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.037) compared to the EC-D group.S:  Addition of bevacizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy might be associated with an increased risk for surgical complications in patients treated with BCS or after repeated surgeries.'

S' The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of 3 subconjunctival bevacizumab injections in patients with an early corneal pterygium recurrence.METHODS:  This study was a nonrandomized single center trial. Patients with an early corneal pterygium recurrence were selected. All patients received 3 subconjunctival bevacizumab (2.5\xe2\x80\x89mg/0.1\xe2\x80\x89mL) injections (basal, 2 and 4 weeks) in the recurrence area of the pterygium. The corneal and corneal-conjunctival neovascularization areas and the corneal opacification area of each pterygium were determined using digital slit lamp pictures.RESULTS:  Thirty-eight patients were enrolled into the study; all patients were injected within 3 months of the diagnosed pterygium recurrence. Interestingly, the bevacizumab injections had a significant effect (P<0.05) on the reduction of corneal, corneal-conjunctival area of neovascularization determined as pixels and on the corneal opacification area determined as mm(2) when comparing the basal values, to the values obtained after 15 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after injections.S:  The vascularized area in all recurrent pterygia and the corneal opacification area with this triple regimen of subconjunctival bevacizumab injections were reduced, which remained until the end of the study. These results suggest that bevacizumab subconjunctival injections could be useful to treat recurrent pterygium.'

S' This phase III trial was performed to assess the potential benefit of adding maintenance erlotinib to bevacizumab after a first-line chemotherapy regimen with bevacizumab for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).PATIENTS AND METHODS:  One thousand one hundred forty-five patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC (stage IIIB with malignant pleural effusion, stage IV, or recurrent) received four cycles of chemotherapy plus bevacizumab. Seven hundred forty-three patients without disease progression or significant toxicity were then randomly assigned (1:1) to bevacizumab (15 mg/kg, day 1, 21-day cycle) plus either placebo or erlotinib (150 mg per day). The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).RESULTS:  Median PFS from time of random assignment was 3.7 months with bevacizumab/placebo and 4.8 months with bevacizumab/erlotinib (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.86; P < .001). Median overall survival (OS) times from random assignment were 13.3 and 14.4 months with bevacizumab/placebo and bevacizumab/erlotinib, respectively (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.21; P = .5341). During the postchemotherapy phase, there were more adverse events (AEs) overall, more grade 3 and 4 AEs (mainly rash and diarrhea), more serious AEs, and more AEs leading to erlotinib/placebo discontinuation in the bevacizumab/erlotinib arm versus the bevacizumab/placebo arm. The incidence of AEs leading to bevacizumab discontinuation was similar in both treatment arms.: "" The addition of erlotinib to bevacizumab significantly improved PFS but not OS. Although generally well tolerated, the modest impact on survival and increased toxicity associated with the addition of erlotinib to bevacizumab maintenance mean that this two-drug maintenance regimen will not lead to a new postchemotherapy standard of care.'

S'"S" This study was an open-label multicenter phase II trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel and bevacizumab as first-line therapy in patients with histologically confirmed unresectable metastatic melanoma.METHODS:  The treatment regimen consisted of a 28-day cycle in which patients received nab-paclitaxel, 150 mg/m through intravenous (IV) infusion weekly for 3 weeks and bevacizumab, 10 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks without a rest period. The 28-day cycle was repeated until there was unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. If 1 drug had to be stopped because of toxicity, treatment was continued with the other drug until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was the progression-free survival rate (PFS) at 4 months.RESULTS:  Fifty patients were enrolled. The PFS rate at 4 months was 75%. The median PFS was 7.6 months and the median overall survival was 16.8 months with a median duration follow-up of 41.6 months. The overall survival rate was 64% at 1 year and 30% at 2 years. Ten patients (20%) remain alive. The objective response rate was 36%. Common adverse events associated with this regimen were peripheral neuropathy, fatigue, alopecia, and gastrointestinal disorders.S:  In this phase II multicenter study, this doublet had significant activity in patients with metastatic melanoma, and was well tolerated.

S' Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a dominantly inherited genetic vascular disorder in which epistaxis is the most frequent manifestation, responsible for high morbidity. Management of this symptom has no standard, and local treatments are often aggressive. Their efficacy is variable and has not been proven. Anti-angiogenic drugs, such as bevacizumab, are a new treatment strategy. Its systemic administration in patients with HHT improves liver damage-related symptoms and epistaxis. To limit the systemic adverse effects of bevacizumab and to ease administration, a local administration seems suitable.PRIMARY : "PRIMARY " To evaluate the tolerance of increasing doses of bevacizumab administered as a nasal spray in patients with HHT-related epistaxis. Secondary objectives were to study the bioavailability and efficacy of bevacizumab against epistaxis when given as a nasal spray.METHODOLOGY: "METHODOLOGY" Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, monocentric study performed sequentially (dose escalation) on 5 groups of 8 patients. Each group was made up of 6 verum and 2 placebos. Five increasing doses of bevacizumab nasal spray (25 mg/mL) were evaluated: 12.5, 25, 50, 75 and 100 mg.RESULTS:  A total of 40 patients were included between October 2011 and October 2012.

S' To determine the effects of bevacizumab on patient-reported outcomes (PROs; secondary end point) in the AURELIA trial.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer were randomly assigned to chemotherapy alone (CT) or with bevacizumab (BEV-CT). PROs were assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Ovarian Cancer Module 28 (EORTC QLQ-OV28) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian Cancer symptom index (FOSI) at baseline and every two or three cycles (8/9 weeks) until disease progression. The primary PRO hypothesis was that more patients receiving BEV-CT than CT would achieve at least a 15% (\xe2\x89\xa5 15-point) absolute improvement on the QLQ-OV28 abdominal/GI symptom subscale (items 31-36) at week 8/9. Patients with missing week 8/9 questionnaires were included as unimproved. Questionnaires from all assessments until disease progression were analyzed using mixed-model repeated-measures (MMRM) analysis. Sensitivity analyses were used to determine the effects of differing assumptions and methods for missing data.RESULTS:  Baseline questionnaires were available from 89% of 361 randomly assigned patients. More BEV-CT than CT patients achieved a \xe2\x89\xa5 15% improvement in abdominal/GI symptoms at week 8/9 (primary PRO end point, 21.9% v 9.3%; difference, 12.7%; 95% CI, 4.4 to 20.9; P = .002). MMRM analysis covering all time points also favored BEV-CT (difference, 6.4 points; 95% CI, 1.3 to 11.6; P = .015). More BEV-CT than CT patients achieved \xe2\x89\xa5 15% improvement in FOSI at week 8/9 (12.2% v 3.1%; difference, 9.0%; 95% CI, 2.9% to 15.2%; P = .003).

S' To describe sources of interindividual variability in bevacizumab disposition in pediatric patients and explore associations among bevacizumab pharmacokinetics and clinical wound healing outcomes.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN" Before tumor resection, three doses of bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) were administered to patients (median age, 12.2 years) enrolled in a multi-institutional osteosarcoma trial. Serial sampling for bevacizumab pharmacokinetics was obtained from 27 patients. A population pharmacokinetic model was fit to the data, and patient demographics and clinical chemistry values were systematically tested as predictive covariates on model parameters. Associations between bevacizumab exposure and wound healing status were evaluated by logistic regression.RESULTS:  Bevacizumab concentration-time data were adequately described by a two-compartment model. Pharmacokinetic parameter estimates were similar to those previously reported in adults, with a long median (range) terminal half-life of 12.2 days (8.6 to 32.4 days) and a volume of distribution indicating confinement primarily to the vascular space, 49.1 mL/kg (27.1 to 68.3 mL/kg). Body composition was a key determinant of bevacizumab exposure, as body mass index percentile was significantly (P < 0.05) correlated to body-weight normalized clearance and volume of distribution. Furthermore, bevacizumab exposure before primary tumor resection was associated with increased risk of major wound healing complications after surgery (P < 0.05).: "" A population pharmacokinetic model for bevacizumab was developed, which demonstrated that variability in bevacizumab exposure using weight-based dosing is related to body composition. Bevacizumab dosage scaling using ideal body weight would provide an improved dosing approach in children by minimizing pharmacokinetic variability and reducing likelihood of major wound healing complications.'

S'Locally advanced gastric cancer (LAGC) is best treated with surgical resection. Bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy has shown promising results in treating advanced gastric cancer. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy using the docetaxel/oxaliplatin/5-FU (DOF) regimen and bevacizumab in LAGC patients.Eighty LAGC patients were randomized to receive DOF alone (n = 40) or DOF plus bevacizumab (n = 40) as neoadjuvant therapy before surgery. The lesions were evaluated at baseline and during treatment. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) were counted using the FISH test. Patients were followed up for 3 years to analyze the disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).The total response rate was significantly higher in the DOF plus bevacizumab group than the DOF group (65% vs 42.5%, P = 0.0436). The addition of bevacizumab significantly increased the surgical resection rate and the R0 resection rate (P < 0.05). The DOF plus bevacizumab group showed significantly greater reduction in CTC counts after neoadjuvant therapy in comparison with the DOF group (P = 0.0335). Although the DOF plus bevacizumab group had significantly improved DFS than the DOF group (15.2 months vs 12.3 months, P = 0.013), the 2 groups did not differ significantly in OS (17.6 \xc2\xb1 1.8 months vs 16.4 \xc2\xb1 1.9 months, P = 0.776. Cox proportional model analysis showed that number of metastatic lymph nodes, CTC reduction, R0 resection, and neoadjuvant therapy are independent prognostic factors for patients with LAGC.Neoadjuvant of DOF regimen plus bevacizumab can improve the R0 resection rate and DFS in LAGC. These beneficial effects might be associated with the reduction in CTC counts.'

It comprised 150 patients selected from the outpatient department with ocular neovascularisation through non-probability purposive sampling. After detailed history and examination, the patients were counseled for intravitreal injection Avastin (bevacjzumab) which was injected into the vitreous cavity in sterile environment in the operation theatre using fully aseptic technique. The injection site was compressed for several seconds to avoid reflux when the needle was removed. Paracentesis was done following the injection as soon as possible. Patients were discharged on moxifloxcin eye drops and steroid antibiotic combination ointment at night time. They were followed up the very next day, after 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year. Injection was repeated after 6 weeks if required and further repetition was done again after 6 weeks according to the need of the patient.RESULTS:  Of the 150 patients, 93 (62%) were males and 57 (38%) were females. Most commonly presenting age group was between 50-60 years (n=51; 34%) followed by 41-50 years (n=41; 27.4%). Most common indication for intravitreal injection Avastin (bevacizumab) was proliferative diabetic retinopathy in 134 (89.33%) patients, followed by age-related macular degeneration (wet type) in 5 (3.3%) patients. Most frequently presenting ocular complication was subconjunctival haemorrhage seen in 35 (23%) patients, followed by regurgitation of drug from the site of injection in 8 (5.3%) patients, transient rise of intraocular pressure in 7 (4.7%) patients, mild uveitiS in 4 (2.7%) patients, lens injury in 3 (2%) patients, conjunctival chemosis and iatrogenic vitreous haemorrhage in 1 (0.7%) patients. Among the systemic complications were acute rise of blood pressure in 4 (2.7%) patients, and mild irritation and allergic reaction on skin in 1 (0.7%) patient.: "" Avastin is generally a safe drug for treatment of ocular neovascularization. The complications reported were more associated with the technique of the procedure and not the drug itself and were easily manageable.

Thirty-seven patients were enrolled: The median age was 67 years (range 38-81); 22 patients were male, and 30 patients had stage IV tumors. The response rate was 32.4 % (95 % CI 18-49.7). The 9-month disease-control rate was 45.9 %. The median PFS was 8.4 months (95 % CI 4.4-10.7), and the median OS was 18.1 months (95 % CI 15.3-20.8 months). Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 6 (16.2 %) patients and grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia in four (10.8 %) patients during induction chemotherapy. Bev- or Vnb-associated toxicities were mild. Switch maintenance treatment with Bev and oral Vnb after first-line Cis, Gem and Bev is feasible in patients with non-squamous NSCLC and may achieve encouraging results in terms of PFS and OS.'

We, therefore, conducted a Phase I study of bevacizumab plus irinotecan in Japanese children with recurrent, progressive or refractory solid tumors.METHODS:  The starting dose was bevacizumab 10 mg/kg over 60-90 min and irinotecan 125 mg/m(2) over 90 min intravenously on Days 1, 15 and 29. The dose of irinotecan was 340 mg/m(2) for patients receiving enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs. Treatment was repeated every 6 weeks for up to three courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.RESULTS:  Of 11 patients, 9 (median age, 9 years) were fully assessable for toxicity and received 24 courses. Dose-limiting toxicities were Grade 2 diarrhea and Grade 4 neutropenia/thrombocytopenia in two of the five patients at dose level 1. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed in four patients at dose level -1 at bevacizumab 10 mg/kg and irinotecan 100 mg/m(2) (270 mg/m(2) for patients taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs). The maximum-tolerated dose was bevacizumab 10 mg/kg and irinotecan 100 mg/m(2). The most frequent non-dose-limiting toxicities were Grade 1 or 2 hypertension, bleeding and hematologic toxicity.

In this retrospective analysis, plasma samples from patients receiving capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab were analyzed to investigate biomarkers of clinical benefit. Forty-one protein biomarkers were tested in 38 patients at baseline and after two cycles of drug administration. Correlations among analytes were evaluated by Spearman analysis. Analyte levels at baseline and changes on-treatment were correlated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) by univariate analysis. Multivariate analyses were determined using the Cox proportional hazard model. Time to event analyses were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared by log-rank test. Baseline levels of vWF and Ang-2 significantly correlated with PFS, while levels of VCAM-1, vWF, TSP-2, IL-8, MMP-2, and Ang-2 correlated with OS (P < 0.05). The fold change of IGF-1 levels from baseline to the end of cycle 2 was correlated with PFS, while fold changes of Ang-2, TSP-2, and TGF-\xce\xb22 correlated with OS. A baseline signature of Ang-2, IGFBP-3, IL-6, and VCAM-1 identified a low-risk and high-risk group of patients (OS: 33.9 months vs. 18.1 months, respectively, P = 0.016). For treatment-related changes, a signature consisting of Ang-2, E-Cadherin, IL-6, MCP-1, OPN, and TGF-\xce\xb21 was able to stratify patients into high- and low-risk groups (PFS: 7.7 months vs. 15.5 months, P = 0.004).

After 3 months, BCVA improved to 0.23\xe2\x80\x89logMAR (bevacizumab) and 358 \xce\xbcm CRST and 0.26 logMAR (triamcinolone) and 308\xe2\x80\x89\xce\xbcm CSRT. After 12 months, BCVA further recovered in the bevacizumab group (0.18 logMAR) but slightly decreased in the triamcinolone group (0.36\xe2\x80\x89logMAR).: "" Intravitreal bevacizumab and triamcinolone are both equally effective in reducing CSRT in early DME. After 6 months, rehabilitation of vision was comparable in both treatment arms, whereas at the final follow-up at month 12, BCVA was superior in the bevacizumab than in the triamcinolone sample. This may be related to cataract development following steroid treatment, as well as to substance-specific mechanisms within the angiogenic versus the inflammatory cascade.'

S'Vascular endothelial growth factor is involved in lymphoma growth, suggesting a potential role for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapies in hematologic malignancies. In this phase III study, patients with CD20-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma were randomized to rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone plus either placebo (R-CHOP) or bevacizumab (RA-CHOP). Treatment was administered every 21 (8 cycles) or 14 days (6 cycles plus 2 rituximab cycles) as per institutional practice. An early analysis of risk/benefit by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board showed that RA-CHOP increased cardiotoxicity without prolonging progression-free survival compared with R-CHOP, and the trial was stopped early. The study protocol was amended to allow for 12 additional months of follow up to evaluate safety. With 787 patients enrolled, median follow up was 23.7 and 23.6 months for R-CHOP and RA-CHOP, respectively. Median progression-free survival for R-CHOP and RA CHOP was 42.9 and 40.2 months, respectively (hazard ratio=1.09; P=0.49). The proportion of deaths was identical for R-CHOP (83 of 387, 21%) and RA-CHOP (82 of 390, 21%). Relative to R-CHOP, RA-CHOP had a higher rate of left ventricular ejection fraction perturbation (18% vs. 8%; odds ratio=2.51; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.60-3.93) and congestive heart failure (16% vs. 7%; odds ratio=2.79; 95%CI: 1.72-4.54). Bevacizumab added to R-CHOP increased cardiac events, without increasing efficacy, arguing against further evaluation of RA-CHOP in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The MAIN study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov identifier:00486759. '

S' In T3 rectal cancer (RC), preoperative chemoradiotherapy [5-fluorouracil (5-FU-RT)] reduces local recurrences, but does not affect overall survival. New therapeutic options are still necessary to improve clinical outcomes.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  This randomized, noncomparative, open-label, multicenter, two arms, phase II study was conducted in MRI-defined locally advanced T3 resectable RC. In arm A, patients received 12-week bevacizumab plus 5-FU, leucovorin and oxaliplatin (Folfox-4) followed with bevacizumab-5-FU-RT before total mesorectal excision (TME). In arm B, patients received only bevacizumab-5-FU-RT before TME. Primary end point was pathological complete response (pCR) rate.RESULTS:  Forty-six patients were randomized in arm A and 45 patients in arm B. In arm A, the rate of pCR was 23.8% [95% confidence interval (CI) 12.1% to 39.5%] statistically superior to the defined standard rate of 10%, P = 0.015. In arm B, the rate of pCR of 11.4% (95% CI 3.8% to 24.6%) was not different from 10%, P = 0.906. No death occurred during the study period, from the start until 8 weeks following surgery. Postoperative fistulas were reported for 16 patients (7 in arm A and 9 in arm B).: "" Even if the addition of bevacizumab induced manageable toxicities including an increased risk of postoperative fistula and no treatment-related death, arm B did not achieve the expected pCR rate in the population of patients included. Induction bevacizumab-Folfox-4 followed by bevacizumab-5-FU-RT is promising. It is however necessary to continue investigations in the management of locally advanced RC.'

S' MNRP1685A is a human monoclonal antibody that blocks binding of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF-B, and placental growth factor 2 to neuropilin-1 resulting in vessel immaturity and VEGF dependency. The safety of combining MNRP1685A with bevacizumab, with or without paclitaxel, was examined.METHODS:  Patients with advanced solid tumors received escalating doses of MNRP1685A (7.5, 15, 24, and 36 mg/kg) with bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks in Arm A (n = 14). Arm B (n = 10) dosing consisted of MNRP1685A (12 and 16 mg/kg) with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg (every 2 weeks) and paclitaxel 90 mg/m(2) (weekly, 3 of 4 weeks). Objectives were to determine safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and the maximum tolerated dose of MNRP1685A.RESULTS:  Infusion reactions (88 %) and transient thrombocytopenia (67 %) represent the most frequent study drug-related adverse events (AEs). Drug-related Grade 2 or 3 proteinuria occurred in 13 patients (54 %). Additional study drug-related AEs occurring in >20 % of patients included neutropenia, alopecia, dysphonia, fatigue, and nausea. Neutropenia occurred only in Arm B. Grade \xe2\x89\xa53 study drug-related AEs in \xe2\x89\xa53 patients included neutropenia (Arm B), proteinuria, and thrombocytopenia. Two confirmed and three unconfirmed partial responses were observed.S:  The safety profiles were consistent with the single-agent profiles of all study drugs. However, a higher than expected rate of clinically significant proteinuria was observed that does not support further testing of MNRP1685A in combination with bevacizumab.'

S' Inhibition of tumor angiogenesis is an effective mechanism to limit tumor growth; dual inhibition may result in additional benefit. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and intetumumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks \xce\xb1v integrins when complexed with \xce\xb2 integrins. We evaluated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the combination of bevacizumab plus intetumumab in patients with refractory solid tumors. We also explored the effects of these agents on plasma-based biomarkers and wound angiogenesis.METHODS:  Patients with refractory solid tumors, Karnofsky performance status \xe2\x89\xa570%, and adequate organ function were eligible. Plasma samples and wound biopsies were obtained at baseline and on-treatment.RESULTS:  Twelve patients were enrolled and received study drug. No tumor responses were noted. Observed toxicities included three cases of transient uveitis likely related to intetumumab and one case of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome likely related to bevacizumab. Biomarker analysis revealed changes in soluble endoglin, soluble E-cadherin, and soluble E-selectin as well as PlGF and VEGF-D while on treatment. There was no observed impact of bevacizumab plus intetumumab on the phosphorylated or total levels of paxillin in wound tissue; however, an increase in the ratio of phospho/total paxillin levels was noted.S:  Bevacizumab and intetumumab can be administered safely in combination. Bevacizumab plus intetumumab treatment resulted in changes in the plasma levels of several extracellular matrix interacting proteins and angiogenic factors.'

S' Treatment with bevacizumab is associated with substantial radiologic response in patients with glioblastoma (GB). However, following this initial response, changes in T2-weighted MRI signal may develop, suggesting an infiltrative pattern of tumor progression. The aim of this study was to differentiate between vasogenic-edema versus tumor-infiltrative area in GB patients.: "" Fourteen patients with GB were longitudinally scanned, before and during intravenous bevacizumab therapy (5/10mg/kg every 2-weeks). A total of 40 MR scans including conventional, diffusion, dynamic susceptibility contrast, dynamic contrast enhancement imaging, and MR-spectroscopy (MRS) were analyzed. Classification of non-enhancing fluid-attenuation-inversion-recovery (FLAIR) area was performed based on mean diffusivity, cerebral blood volume and flow maps, and further characterized using multiple MRI parameters.RESULTS:  The non-enhancing FLAIR lesion area was classified into: vasogenic-edema, characterized by reduced perfusion and increased FLAIR values; or tumor-infiltrative area, characterized by increased perfusion. Tumor-infiltrative area demonstrated a higher malignant pattern on MRS compared to areas of vasogenic-edema. Substantial reductions of the enhanced T1-weighted (58 \xc2\xb1 10%) and hyperintense FLAIR (53 \xc2\xb1 9%) lesion volumes were detected mainly during the first weeks of therapy, with a shift to an infiltrative pattern of tumor progression thereafter, as detected by an increase in tumor-infiltrative area in the majority of patients, which correlated with progression-free survival (week 8: r=-0.86, p=0.003, week 16: r=-0.99, p=0.001).: "" Characterization of non-enhancing hyperintense FLAIR lesion area in GB patients can provide an MR-based biomarker, indicating a shift to an infiltrative progression pattern, and may improve therapy response assessment in patients following bevacizumab therapy.'

S'Bevacizumab is a humanized antihuman VEGF-A monoclonal antibody. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intraperitoneal administration of cisplatin plus bevacizumab (Avastin) in the management of malignant ascites in ovarian epithelial cancer. Fifty-eight ovarian epithelial cancer patients with malignant ascites were randomly assigned to receive either intraperitoneal administration of cisplatin only (control group, n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa027, cisplatin: 40\xc2\xa0mg/m(2) every 2\xc2\xa0weeks, for 6\xc2\xa0weeks) or cisplatin plus bevacizumab (study group, n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa031, cisplatin: 40\xc2\xa0mg/m(2), bevacizumab: 300\xc2\xa0mg, every 2\xc2\xa0weeks for 6\xc2\xa0weeks). All patients regularly received TC regimen (paclitaxel 135\xc2\xa0mg/m(2)\xc2\xa0d1\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0carboplatin AUC 5\xc2\xa0d1) every 3\xc2\xa0weeks. The outcome, quality of life (QoL) and adverse effect of the treatment were analyzed, and VEGF and CA-125 level in ascites were detected by ELISA. After treatment with cisplatin plus bevacizumab, VEGF level in ascites was significantly decreased compared to baseline (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05). Meanwhile, ascites VEGF level of study group was significantly lower than that of control group (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05). The overall response rate (ORR) of study group was significantly higher than that of control group (ORR 90.32 vs. 59.26\xc2\xa0%, P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05). QoL improvement rate of study group was also significantly higher than that of control group (93.55 vs. 48.15\xc2\xa0%, P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05). All patients were well tolerated, and no serious adverse effect occurred. Intraperitoneal administration of cisplatin plus bevacizumab is effective and safe for the management of malignant ascites in ovarian epithelial cancer. '

The primary end point of the study was progression-free survival (PFS). A 50% improvement in median PFS in comparison with standard pemetrexed/platinum combinations (from 6 to 9 months) was postulated.RESULTS:  Seventy-six patients were evaluable for analysis. A partial response was achieved in 26 cases (34.2%, 95% CI 23.7-46.0%). Forty-four (57.9%, 95% CI 46.0-69.1%) had stable disease. Median PFS and overall survival were 6.9 and 15.3 months, respectively. Haematological and non-haematological toxicities were generally mild; however, some severe adverse events were reported, including grade 3-4 fatigue in 8% and bowel perforation in 4% of patients. Three toxic deaths occurred.: "" The primary end point of the trial was not reached. However, due to the limitation of a non-randomised phase II design, further data are needed before drawing any definite conclusion on the role of bevacizumab in MPM.'

S' Preclinical and early clinical data support the use of Vascular Epithelial Growth Factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy with trastuzumab in Human Epidermal Receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer. Adding bevacizumab to a taxane (docetaxel or paclitaxel) improves progression free survival (PFS) of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients.S: "S" We evaluated the efficacy and feasibility of combining bevacizumab with trastuzumab and docetaxel in patients with HER2- positive MBC who received 0-1 prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease. The primary end point was PFS.: "" Eligible patients received bevacizumab (15 mg/kg), trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose followed by 6 mg/kg), and docetaxel (100 mg/m2 initially, later amended to 75 mg/m2) every three weeks for six cycles and then were allowed to receive bevacizumab and trastuzumab alone. Results Thirteen (50%) of 26 patients enrolled completed all 6 cycles of bevacizumab, trastuzumab and docetaxel and went on to receive bevacizumab and trastuzumab alone (median: 11 cycles). The most common grade 3 or 4 toxicities include: neutropenia (8%), septic death (4%), infection not associated with neutropenia (15%), fatigue (27%), mylagia and/or arthraligia (20%), and hand-foot syndrome (8%). One patient (4%) and six patients (23%) developed grade 3 and grade 2 hypertension, respectively. Two (8%) patients had transient grade 2 drop in Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) with full recovery later. The median progression free survival (PFS) was 14.3 months (95% CI: 9.3-35 months), the objective response rate (ORR), defined as the best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) was (12/26) 46%. The clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as the best response of CR or PR or stable disease (SD) for at least 24 weeks, was (18/26) 69% (95% CI: 48-86%).: "" The combination of bevacizumab, trastuzumab and docetaxel is well tolerated and is clinically active in patients with HER2-positive MBC, with response rate and PFS comparable to previous reports utilizing higher dose of docetaxel (100 mg/m2). Recent randomized trials did not demonstrate additional overall survival (OS) benefit of adding bevacizumab to trastuzumab and docetaxel despite an improvement in PFS. Identification of predictive biomarkers and careful patient selection should be incorporated in further investigation of anti-VEGF in breast cancer.'

S' To explore the benefit of rapid induction with intravitreal bevacizumab for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD).DESIGN: "DESIGN" Single-institution prospective randomized pilot study.METHODS:  Patients with treatment-na\xc3\xafve neovascular AMD were randomized 1:1:1 into 1 of 3 groups based on the induction sequence: (1) every 2 weeks for 3 consecutive injections; (2) every 4 weeks for 3 consecutive injections; and (3) immediate pro re nata (prn) after the first injection. Retinal angiomatous proliferation and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy were excluded. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness using optical coherence tomography (OCT) were measured at baseline and at each follow-up. After induction, bevacizumab was administered as needed based mainly on OCT. Main outcome measure was mean initial fluid-free interval after induction. Secondary outcomes were mean improvement in BCVA and central retinal thickness.RESULTS:  Each group included 30 patients (30 eyes). Mean initial fluid-free interval was 2.4, 3.4, and 3.5 months for biweekly induction, monthly induction, and immediate prn groups, respectively (P = .03). Significance was lost when corrected for age and sex (P = .073). Mean improvement in BCVA, central retinal thickness, and total number of injections were similar among the groups at 12 months. Six eyes in the biweekly induction group developed subretinal fibrosis vs no eyes in the other 2 groups (P = .003).: "" Biweekly induction with intravitreal bevacizumab for treatment-na\xc3\xafve neovascular AMD does not increase initial fluid-free interval or cause significant anatomic and functional benefit compared to monthly induction or immediate prn. There is also the potential development of subretinal fibrosis with biweekly induction.'
